In this study, we established a lethal animal model using BALB/c mice and a mouse-passaged isolate (QHmusX) from a European lineage of SARS-CoV-2. The QHmusX strain induced acute respiratory illness, associated with diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary edema, in TH2-prone adult BALB/c mice, but not in young mice or TH1-prone C57BL/6 mice. We also showed that immunization of adult BALB/c mice with recombinant spike protein without appropriate adjuvant caused eosinophilic immunopathology with TH2-shifted immune response and insufficient neutralizing antibodies after QHmusX infection. This lethal mouse model is useful for evaluating vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may provide new insights into the disease pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","We thank S.

13081,pub.1163022764,10.1002/jmv.28990,37537838,,,Genomic analysis of SARS‐CoV‐2 in forensic autopsy cases of COVID‐19,"Numerous genomic analyses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been conducted, highlighting its variations and lineage transitions. Despite the importance of forensic autopsy in investigating deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including out-of-hospital deaths, viral genomic analysis has rarely been reported due in part to postmortem changes. In this study, various specimens were collected from 18 forensic autopsy cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed the distribution of the virus in the body, primarily in the respiratory organs. Next-generation sequencing determined the complete genome sequences in 15 of the 18 cases, although some cases showed severe postmortem changes or degradation of tissue RNA. Intrahost genomic diversity of the virus was identified in one case of death due to COVID-19. The accumulation of single-nucleotide variations in the lung of the case suggested the intrahost evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Lung of the case showed diffuse alveolar damage histologically and positivity for SARS-CoV-2 by immunohistochemical analysis and in situ hybridization, indicating virus-associated pneumonia. This study provides insights into the feasibility of genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in forensic autopsy cases and the potential for uncovering important information in COVID-19 deaths, including out-of-hospital deaths.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank Aika Mori at Chiba University and Makoto Nakajima at the University of Tokyo for their support in collecting samples.

The present study examined the effects of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccine on the oral microbiome.MethodsForty healthy Japanese oral healthcare personnel were recruited, and unstimulated saliva was collected before vaccination, after the 1st vaccination, and after the 2nd vaccination. Genomic DNA was extracted from saliva samples, and PCR amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene were analyzed using next-generation sequencing.

Although cigarette smoke is generally believed to be harmful to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treatments were surprisingly found to suppress the expression of ACE2 in HepG2 cells. We thus tried to clarify the mechanism of CSE effects on expression of ACE2 in mammalian cells. Because RNA-seq analysis suggested that suppressive effects on ACE2 might be inversely correlated with induction of the genes regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the AHR agonists 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) and omeprazole (OMP) were tested to assess whether those treatments affected ACE2 expression. Both FICZ and OMP clearly suppressed ACE2 expression in a dose-dependent manner along with inducing CYP1A1. Knock-down experiments indicated a reduction of ACE2 by FICZ treatment in an AHR-dependent manner. Finally, treatments of AHR agonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection into Vero E6 cells as determined with immunoblotting analyses detecting SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleocapsid protein. We here demonstrate that treatment with AHR agonists, including FICZ, and OMP, decreases expression of ACE2 via AHR activation, resulting in suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mammalian cells.","We greatly appreciate the technical support provided by Ms. Chiyo Oda.

At this time, genomic research is concerned with exploiting available datasets and knowledge to fuel discovery on this novel disease. Studies that can precisely characterize the gene expression profiles of human hosts infected by SARS-CoV-2 are of significant relevance. However, not many such experiments have yet been produced to date, nor made publicly available online. Thus, it is of paramount importance that data analysts explore all possibilities to integrate information coming from similar viruses and related diseases; interestingly, microarray gene profile experiments become extremely valuable for this purpose. This chapter reviews the aspects that should be considered when integrating transcriptomics data, considering mainly samples infected by different viruses and combining together various data types and also the extracted knowledge. It describes a series of scenarios from studies performed in literature and it suggests possible other directions of noteworthy integration.","A.B. is supported by the European Research Council Executive Agency under the EU Framework Programme Horizon 2020, ERC Advanced Grant number 693174 GeCo (data-driven Genomic Computing).",,Methods in Molecular Biology,Microarray Data Analysis,Giuseppe Agapito,Springer Nature,"1064-3745, 1940-6029",COVID-19; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Humans; Pandemics; Transcriptome,2021-12-14,2021,2021-12-14,2022,2401,,195-215,All OA; Green,Chapter,"Bernasconi, Anna; Cascianelli, Silvia","Bernasconi, Anna (Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy); Cascianelli, Silvia (Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy)","Bernasconi, Anna (Politecnico di Milano)","Bernasconi, Anna (Politecnico di Milano); Cascianelli, Silvia (Politecnico di Milano)",Politecnico di Milano,grid.4643.5,Milan,,Italy,European Research Council,EC & ERC - European Union,Belgium,grant.5935940,693174,0,0,,0.0,1,https://re.public.polimi.it/bitstream/11311/1192506/1/Directions_for_integrating_microarray_gene_expression_profiles_in_COVID_19_related_studies.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143844171,31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,Vaccine Related; Biodefense; Prevention; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Human Genome; Genetics,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,3 Good Health and Well Being

This study included 53 health care workers who received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. S-IgG and nucleocapsid (N)-IgG antibody titers were measured by ELISA. Neutralizing (NT) antibody responses against three variants (Wuhan D614 G: KUH003, Alpha, and Delta) were evaluated before and after the first and second vaccination. N-IgG were not detected in any serum samples. S-IgG antibody titers remarkably increased after two BNT162b2 vaccine doses in all participants. S-IgG antibody titers were strongly correlated with NT titers against three variants of live viruses: KUH003 (r = 0.86), Alpha (r = 0.72), and Delta (r = 0.84). Serum samples from participants after one dose of BNT162b2 neutralized Alpha efficiently (median titer, 113.0), but median NT titers against KUH003 and Delta variants were lower, 57.0 and 28.0, respectively (p < .01). Two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine elicited a strong immune response in this study. The second dose was required for induction of a strong booster effect. Serum collected from BNT162b2 vaccine recipients contained significantly lower neutralizing activity against Delta than that of against KUH003 (p < .0001) and Alpha (p < .0001). If a new variant emerges, live virus-based NT titers should be examined in serum obtained from vaccine recipients to evaluate vaccine efficacy for protection against infection.","SARS-CoV-2 N-IgG and S-IgG antibody titers were measured by Denka at Gosen site (Niigata, Japan) using an originally developed ELISA kit.",This work was supported by a 2021 Aichi Health Promotion Foundation Grant for Medical Research and Health Promotion Activities and a 2021 grant-in-aid from Fujita Health University.,Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics,,,Taylor & Francis,"2164-5515, 2164-554X","Adult; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; BNT162 Vaccine; COVID-19; Vaccines; Vaccination; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Immunoglobulin G; Antibodies, Viral",2022-09-12,2022,2022-09-12,2022-11-30,18,6,2105611,All OA; Gold,Article,"Higashimoto, Yuki; Kozawa, Kei; Miura, Hiroki; Kawamura, Yoshiki; Ihira, Masaru; Hiramatsu, Hiroyuki; Suzuki, Ryota; Haga, Kei; Takai-Todaka, Reiko; Sawada, Akihito; Katayama, Kazuhiko; Yoshikawa, Tetsushi","Higashimoto, Yuki (Faculty of Medical Technology, Fujita Health University School of Medical Sciences, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan); Kozawa, Kei (Department of Pediatrics, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan); Miura, Hiroki (Department of Pediatrics, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan; Present Address: Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of CaliforniaDavis (UC Davis), Sacramento, California, USA.); Kawamura, Yoshiki (Department of Pediatrics, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan); Ihira, Masaru (Faculty of Clinical Engineering, Fujita Health University School of Medical Sciences, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan); Hiramatsu, Hiroyuki (Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Fujita Health University Hospital, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan); Suzuki, Ryota (Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Fujita Health University Hospital, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan); Haga, Kei (Laboratory of Viral Infection Control, Department of Infection Control Science and Immunology, Ōmura Satoshi Memorial Institute & Graduate School of Infection Control Sciences, Kitasato University, Tokyo, Japan); Takai-Todaka, Reiko (Laboratory of Viral Infection Control, Department of Infection Control Science and Immunology, Ōmura Satoshi Memorial Institute & Graduate School of Infection Control Sciences, Kitasato University, Tokyo, Japan); Sawada, Akihito (Laboratory of Viral Infection Control, Department of Infection Control Science and Immunology, Ōmura Satoshi Memorial Institute & Graduate School of Infection Control Sciences, Kitasato University, Tokyo, Japan); Katayama, Kazuhiko (Laboratory of Viral Infection Control, Department of Infection Control Science and Immunology, Ōmura Satoshi Memorial Institute & Graduate School of Infection Control Sciences, Kitasato University, Tokyo, Japan); Yoshikawa, Tetsushi (Department of Pediatrics, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan)","Higashimoto, Yuki (Fujita Health University)","Higashimoto, Yuki (Fujita Health University); Kozawa, Kei (Fujita Health University); Miura, Hiroki (Fujita Health University; University of California, Davis); Kawamura, Yoshiki (Fujita Health University); Ihira, Masaru (Fujita Health University); Hiramatsu, Hiroyuki (Fujita Health University Hospital); Suzuki, Ryota (Fujita Health University Hospital); Haga, Kei (Kitasato University); Takai-Todaka, Reiko (Kitasato University); Sawada, Akihito (Kitasato University); Katayama, Kazuhiko (Kitasato University); Yoshikawa, Tetsushi (Fujita Health University)","University of California, Davis; Fujita Health University; Fujita Health University Hospital; Kitasato University",grid.27860.3b; grid.256115.4; grid.471500.7; grid.410786.c,Davis; Toyoake; Nagoya; Tokyo,California; ; ; ,United States; Japan; Japan; Japan,,,,,,2,2,,,1,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2022.2105611,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150931486,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3204 Immunology,Prevention; Infectious Diseases; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Clinical Research; Vaccine Related; Biodefense; Immunization,Infection,,,,A01 Clinical Medicine,3 Good Health and Well Being

This difficulty can be attributed to the limitations associated with the analytical methodology for presenting the differences among genomic sequences. In this study, we critically analysed the early data to explain the start and spread of the pandemic.
Methods: Objective analyses of the RNA sequences of earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2 (up to September 1, 2020, available in DDBJ and GISAID) were performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The results were compared with information on the collection dates and location. The PCA was also conducted for 12 variants of interest to the WHO as of September 2021, and compared with earlier data.
Results: The pandemic began in Wuhan, China. This strain was suspected to be related to other reported animal viruses; however, they had a minimal similarity. The strain then spreads via three routes while accumulating mutations. Several viral subgroups were identified along the routes, each with a large number of patients reported, indicating high infectivity to humans. These routes were only confirmed by the early data analysis, because newer variants would have more mutations, and would be preferentially be examined by PCA if they were included. On the original axes found in the early variants, the newer variants revealed that they retained previously acquired mutations, which helped to reveal the viral ancestors of the newer variants. The rate of mutation was found to be comparable to that of the influenza H1N1 virus, which causes recurrent seasonal epidemics. Another threat imposed by SARS-CoV-2 is that if the pandemic cannot be contained, new variants may emerge annually, preventing herd immunity.",We would like to thank Editage and Enago for English language editing.,The authors received no funding for this work.,PeerJ,,Joseph Gillespie,PeerJ,2167-8359,Animals; Humans; COVID-19; Mutation; SARS-CoV-2,2022-03-30,2022,2022-03-30,,10,,e12681,All OA; Gold,Article,"Konishi, Tomokazu","Konishi, Tomokazu (Graduate school of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, Akita, Japan)","Konishi, Tomokazu (Akita Prefectural University)","Konishi, Tomokazu (Akita Prefectural University)",Akita Prefectural University,grid.411285.b,Akita,,Japan,,,,,,2,2,,,6,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12681,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146846207,31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,Emerging Infectious Diseases; Pneumonia & Influenza; Influenza; Biodefense; Vaccine Related; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Pneumonia; Genetics; Lung,Infection,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,,,"A02 Public Health, Health Services and Primary Care",

Therefore, to investigate the effect of multiple doses of mRNA vaccine for the newly emerged variants on these populations, cross-neutralizing antibody titers were examined against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, including BQ.1.1 and XBB.
METHODS: Blood samples were taken from residents at four long-term care facilities in Hyogo prefecture, Japan (median age, 91 years), after 3rd (n = 67) and 4th (n = 48) mRNA vaccinations, from April to October 2022. A live virus microneutralization assay was performed to determine the neutralizing antibody titers in participants' sera.
RESULTS: After 3rd vaccination, cross-neutralizing antibody prevalence against conventional (D614G) virus, Delta, Omicron BA.2, BA.5, BA.2.75, BQ.1.1, and XBB were 100%, 97%, 81%, 51%, 67%, 4%, and 21%, respectively. After 4th vaccination, the antibody positivity rates increased to 100%, 100%, 98%, 79%, 92%, 31%, and 52%, respectively. The 4th vaccination significantly increased cross-neutralizing antibody titers against all tested variants.
CONCLUSION: The positivity rates for BQ.1.1 and XBB increased after 4th vaccination, although the titer value was lower than those of BA.5 and BA.2.75. Considering the rapid mutation of viruses and the efficacy of vaccines, it may be necessary to create a system that can develop vaccines suitable for each epidemic in consideration of the epidemic of the virus.","Declaration of Competing Interest This statement is to certify that all Authors have seen and approved the manuscript being submitted.

Recently, the mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated to induce secretory antibodies in the oral and nasal cavities in addition to a systemic immune response. However, the mechanism of induced immune stimulation effect on mucosal immunity and commensal bacteria profile remains unclear.MethodsHere, we longitudinally analysed the changing nasal microbiota and both systemic and nasal immune response upon SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, and evaluated how mRNA vaccination influenced nasal microbiota in 18 healthy participants who had received the third BNT162b.ResultsThe nasal S-RBD IgG level correlated significantly with plasma IgG levels until 1 month and the levels were sustained for 3 months post-vaccination. In contrast, nasal S-RBD IgA induction peaked at 1 month, albeit slightly, and correlated only with plasma IgA, but the induction level decreased markedly at 3 months post-vaccination. 16 S rRNA sequencing of the nasal microbiota post-vaccination revealed not an overall change, but a decrease in certain opportunistic bacteria, mainly Fusobacterium. The decrease in these bacteria was more pronounced in those who exhibited nasal S-RBD IgA induction, and those with higher S-RBD IgA induction had lower relative amounts of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas pre-vaccination. In addition, plasma and mucosal S-RBD IgG levels correlated with decreased commensal pathogens such as Finegoldia.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that the third dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination induced S-RBD antibodies in the nasal mucosa and may have stimulated mucosal immunity against opportunistic bacterial pathogens. This effect, albeit probably secondary, may be considered one of the benefits of mRNA vaccination. Furthermore, our data suggest that a cooperative function of mucosal and systemic immunity in the reduction of bacteria and provides a better understanding of the symbiotic relationship between the host and bacteria in the nasal mucosa.","We thank all volunteers who participated in this study;

To elucidate the current status in Japan, we analyzed totally 2,000 sera in August (n = 1,000) and December (n = 1,000) 2021 collected from individuals who underwent a health check-up. The anti-N seropositive rate were 2.1% and 3.9% in August and December 2021, respectively, demonstrating a Delta variant endemic during that time; it was approximately twofold higher than the rate based on the PCR-based diagnosis. The anti-S seropositive rate was 38.7% in August and it reached 90.8% in December, in concordance with the vaccination rate in Japan. In the December cohort, 78.7% of the sera showed neutralizing activity against the Delta variant, whereas that against the Omicron was much lower at 36.6%. These analyses revealed that effective immunity against the Delta variant was established in December 2021, however, prompt three-dose vaccination is needed to overcome Omicron's outbreak.","We thank Kazuro Sugimura MD, PhD (Superintendent, Hyogo Prefectural Hospital Agency and Professor, Kobe University) for his full support of this study.

Here, we establish an efficient human alveolosphere culture method and sphere-based drug testing platform for SARS-CoV-2. Alveolospheres exhibit indolent growth in a Wnt- and R-spondin-dependent manner. Gene expression, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy analyses reveal the presence of alveolar cells in alveolospheres. Alveolospheres express ACE2 and allow SARS-CoV-2 to propagate nearly 100,000-fold in 3 days of infection. Whereas lopinavir and nelfinavir, protease inhibitors used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, have a modest anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2, remdesivir, a nucleotide prodrug, shows an anti-viral effect at the concentration comparable with the circulating drug level. These results demonstrate the validity of the alveolosphere culture system for the development of therapeutic agents to combat SARS-CoV-2.","We thank Chinatsu Yonekawa for technical assistance.

Lebanon experienced its largest wave of COVID-19 infections from January to April 2021. Limited genomic surveillance was undertaken, with just 26 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available for this period, nine of which were from travellers from Lebanon detected by other countries. Additional genome sequencing is thus needed to allow surveillance of variants in circulation. In total, 905 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced using the ARTIC protocol. The genomes were derived from SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, selected retrospectively from the sentinel COVID-19 surveillance network, to capture diversity of location, sampling time, sex, nationality and age. Although 16 PANGO lineages were circulating in Lebanon in January 2021, by February there were just four, with the Alpha variant accounting for 97 % of samples. In the following 2 months, all samples contained the Alpha variant. However, this had changed dramatically by June and July 2021, when all samples belonged to the Delta variant. This study documents a ten-fold increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available from Lebanon. The Alpha variant, first detected in the UK, rapidly swept through Lebanon, causing the country's largest wave to date, which peaked in January 2021. The Alpha variant was introduced to Lebanon multiple times despite travel restrictions, but the source of these introductions remains uncertain. The Delta variant was detected in Gambia in travellers from Lebanon in mid-May, suggesting community transmission in Lebanon several weeks before this variant was detected in the country. Prospective sequencing in June/July 2021 showed that the Delta variant had completely replaced the Alpha variant in under 6 weeks.","The Quadram Institute authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); their research was funded by the BBSRC Institute Strategic Programme Microbes in the Food Chain BB/R012504/1 and its constituent project BBS/E/F/000PR10352, in addition to the Quadram Institute Bioscience BBSRC funded Core Capability Grant (project number BB/CCG1860/1).

Consensus regarding the biological functions of ORF8 is lacking, largely because the fundamental characteristics of this protein in cells have not been determined. To clarify these features, we herein established an ORF8 expression system in 293T cells. Using this system, approximately 41% of the ORF8 expressed in 293T cells were secreted extracellularly as a glycoprotein homodimer with inter/intramolecular disulfide bonds. Intracellular ORF8 was sensitive to the glycosidase Endo H, whereas the secreted portion was Endo-H-resistant, suggesting that secretion occurs via a conventional pathway. Additionally, immunoblotting analysis showed that the total amounts of the major histocompatibility complex class Ι (MHC-I), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and SARS-CoV-2 spike (CoV-2 S) proteins coexpressed in cells were not changed by the increased ORF8 expression, although FACS analysis revealed that the expression of the cell surface MHC-I protein, but not that of ACE2 and CoV-2 S proteins, was reduced by ORF8 expression. Finally, we demonstrate by RNA-seq analysis that ORF8 had no significant stimulatory effects in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Taken together, our results provide fundamental evidence that the ORF8 glycoprotein acts as a secreted homodimer, and its functions are likely associated with the intracellular transport and/or extracellular signaling in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","We thank Dr Kenzo Tokunaga of Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan, for his generous gift of the pC-SARS2-S WT and pC-ACE2 WT plasmids and Dr Takamasa Ueno of Division of Infection and Immunity, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University Kumamoto, Japan, for kindly providing the pcDNA3.1 HLA-A∗02:01 plasmid.",This work was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (grant numbers JP20K07533 (K.

Drug repurposing has attracted more attention than traditional approaches due to its potential for a time- and cost-effective discovery of new applications for the existing FDA-approved drugs. Given the reported success of machine learning (ML) in virtual drug screening, it is warranted as a promising approach to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The implementation of ML in drug repurposing requires the presence of reliable digital databases for the extraction of the data of interest. Numerous databases archive research data from studies so that it can be used for different purposes. This article reviews two aspects: the frequently used databases in ML-based drug repurposing studies for SARS-CoV-2, and the recent ML models that have been developed for the prospective prediction of potential inhibitors against the new virus. Both types of ML models, Deep Learning models and conventional ML models, are reviewed in terms of introduction, methodology, and its recent applications in the prospective predictions of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Furthermore, the features and limitations of the databases are provided to guide researchers in choosing suitable databases according to their research interests.","The article processing charges were thankfully covered and supported by the CMHS research office.

Here, we analyzed the temporal changes in microbiota composition and the correlation between inflammation biomarkers/cytokines and microbiota in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We obtained stool specimens, blood samples, and patient records from 22 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and performed 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis of stool samples over the course of disease onset compared to 40 healthy individual stool samples. We analyzed the correlation between the changes in the gut microbiota and plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels. Immediately after admission, differences in the gut microbiota were observed between COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects, mainly including enrichment of the classes Bacilli and Coriobacteriia and decrease in abundance of the class Clostridia. The bacterial profile continued to change throughout the hospitalization, with a decrease in short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria including Faecalibacterium and an increase in the facultatively anaerobic bacteria Escherichia-Shigella. A consistent increase in Eggerthella belonging to the class Coriobacteriia was observed. The abundance of the class Clostridia was inversely correlated with interferon-γ level and that of the phylum Actinobacteria, which was enriched in COVID-19, and was positively correlated with gp130/sIL-6Rb levels. Dysbiosis was continued even after 21 days from onset. The intestines tended to be an aerobic environment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Because the composition of the gut microbiota correlates with the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, this finding emphasizes the need to understand how pathology is related to the temporal changes in the specific gut microbiota observed in COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE There is growing evidence that the commensal microbiota of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts regulates local and systemic inflammation (gut-lung axis). COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease, but the involvement of microbiota changes in the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear. The composition of the gut microbiota of patients with COVID-19 changed over time during hospitalization, and the intestines tended to be an aerobic environment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These changes in gut microbiota may induce increased intestinal permeability, called leaky gut, allowing bacteria and toxins to enter the circulatory system and further aggravate the systemic inflammatory response. Since gut microbiota composition correlates with levels of proinflammatory cytokines, this finding highlights the need to understand how pathology relates to the gut environment, including the temporal changes in specific gut microbiota observed in COVID-19 patients.","We thank all volunteers who participated in this study; Naoko Nishiyama for technical assistance with the experiments; Natsuko Kubo, Tomoe Senkoji, and Megumi Kubota for assistance in clinical data management; Hiroyuki Nagai, Shinya Yamamoto, Hiromi Isshiki, Tomoko Sato, Mika Kogayu, Fukue Kameda, Akari Fukuda, Etsuko Nagai, Hiroko Shibata, Takashi Momota, Osamu Takahashi, and Tokiko Nagamura for assistance in clinical sample collection; and Nozomi Yusa and Seiya Imoto for support of sequencing analysis and Editage (www.editage.com) for English language editing.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells trigger senescence-like cell-cycle arrest2,3 in neighboring uninfected cells in a paracrine manner via virus-induced cytokine production. In cultured human cells or bronchial organoids, these SASR-CoV-2 infection-induced senescent cells express high levels of a series of inflammatory factors known as senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs)4 in a sustained manner, even after SARS-CoV-2 is no longer detectable. We also show that the expression of the senescence marker CDKN2A (refs. 5,6) and various SASP factor4 genes is increased in the pulmonary cells of patients with severe post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Furthermore, we find that mice exposed to a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2 exhibit prolonged signs of cellular senescence and SASP in the lung at 14 days after infection when the virus was undetectable, which could be substantially reduced by the administration of senolytic drugs7. The sustained infection-induced paracrine senescence described here may be involved in the long-term inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","We thank J. Sakuragi and T.

Initially, Syrian hamsters were inoculated with a lineage A, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617.2 or a subvariant of Omicron, BA.1 strain and then reinfected with the BA.1 strain 5 weeks later. Subsequently, the impact of reinfection with Omicron subvariants (BA.1 and BA.2) in individuals previously infected with the BA.1 strain was examined. Although viral infection and replication were suppressed in both the upper and lower airways, following reinfection, virus-associated RNA was detected in the airways of most hamsters. Viral replication was more strongly suppressed in the lower respiratory tract than in the upper respiratory tract. Consistent amino acid substitutions were observed in the upper respiratory tract of infected hamsters after primary infection with variant BA.1, whereas diverse mutations appeared in hamsters reinfected with the same variant. Histopathology showed no acute pneumonia or disease enhancement in any of the reinfection groups and, in addition, the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the airways of reinfected animals was only mildly elevated. These findings are important for understanding the risk of reinfection with new variants of SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the widespread use of COVID-19 vaccines has resulted in individual differences in immune status against SARS-CoV-2. A decay in immunity over time and the emergence of variants that partially evade the immune response can also lead to reinfection. In this study, we demonstrated that, in hamsters, immunity acquired following primary infection with previous SARS-CoV-2 variants was effective in preventing the onset of pneumonia after reinfection with the Omicron variant. However, viral infection and multiplication in the upper respiratory tract were still observed after reinfection. We also showed that more diverse nonsynonymous mutations appeared in the upper respiratory tract of reinfected hamsters that had acquired immunity from primary infection. This hamster model reveals the within-host evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and its pathology after reinfection, and provides important information for countermeasures against diversifying SARS-CoV-2 variants.","We thank Dr. Shutoku Matsuyama and Dr. Makoto Takeda (National Institute of Infectious Disease) for providing SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

We named them MO1, MO2, and MO3. Among them, MO1 showed particularly high neutralizing activity against authentic variants: D614G, Delta, BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.2.75, and BA.5. Furthermore, MO1 suppressed BA.5 infection in hamsters. A structural analysis revealed that MO1 binds to the conserved epitope of seven variants, including Omicron variants BA.5 and BA.2.75, in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. MO1 targets an epitope conserved among Omicron variants BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5 in a unique binding mode. Our findings confirm that D614G-derived vaccination can induce neutralizing antibodies that recognize the epitopes conserved among the SARS-CoV-2 variants. IMPORTANCE Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 acquired escape ability from host immunity and authorized antibody therapeutics and thereby have been spreading worldwide. We reported that patients infected with an early SARS-CoV-2 variant, D614G, and who received subsequent two-dose mRNA vaccination have high neutralizing antibody titer against Omicron lineages. It was speculated that the patients have neutralizing antibodies broadly effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants by targeting common epitopes. Here, we explored human monoclonal antibodies from B cells of the patients. One of the monoclonal antibodies, named MO1, showed high potency against broad SARS-CoV-2 variants including BA.2.75 and BA.5 variants. The results prove that monoclonal antibodies that have common neutralizing epitopes among several Omicrons were produced in patients infected with D614G and who received mRNA vaccination.","We thank Kazuro Sugimura for his full support of this study.

Millions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced during the pandemic. However, downloading SARS-CoV-2 genomes from databases is slow and unreliable, largely due to suboptimal choice of compression method. We evaluated the available compressors and found that Nucleotide Archival Format (NAF) would provide a drastic improvement compared with current methods. For Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Flu Data's (GISAID) pre-compressed datasets, NAF would increase efficiency 52.2 times for gzip-compressed data and 3.7 times for xz-compressed data. For DNA DataBank of Japan (DDBJ), NAF would improve throughput 40 times for gzip-compressed data. For GenBank and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), NAF would accelerate data distribution by a factor of 29.3 times compared with uncompressed FASTA. This article provides a tutorial for installing and using NAF.

The initial version (v1.0) of the VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) software package that GenBank uses to automatically validate and annotate incoming viral sequences is too slow and memory intensive to process many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in a reasonable amount of time. Additionally, long stretches of ambiguous N nucleotides, which are common in many SARS-CoV-2 sequences, prevent VADR from accurate validation and annotation.
Results: VADR has been updated to more accurately and rapidly annotate SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Stretches of consecutive Ns are now identified and temporarily replaced with expected nucleotides to facilitate processing, and the slowest steps have been overhauled using blastn and glsearch , increasing speed, reducing the memory requirement from 64Gb to 2Gb per thread, and allowing simple, coarse-grained parallelization on multiple processors per host.
Conclusion: VADR is now nearly 1000 times faster than it was in early 2020 for processing SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted to GenBank. It has been used to screen and annotate more than 1.5 million SARS-CoV-2 sequences since June 2020, and it is now efficient enough to cope with the current rate of hundreds of thousands of submitted sequences per month.

Here, using humanized mice, we identified an RBS antibody with a germline VH gene that potently neutralized SARS-related coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants. X-ray crystallography revealed coordinated recognition by the heavy chain of non-RBS conserved sites and the light chain of RBS with a binding angle mimicking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The minimum footprints in the hypervariable region of RBS contributed to the breadth of neutralization, which was enhanced by immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) class switching. The coordinated binding resulted in broad neutralization of SARS-CoV and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Low-dose therapeutic antibody treatment in hamsters reduced the virus titers and morbidity during SARS-CoV-2 challenge. The structural basis for broad neutralizing activity may inform the design of a broad spectrum of therapeutics and vaccines.","We thank Akira Dosaka, Eriko Izumiyama, and Ryoko Itami at NIID for technical support.

Here, we report that the human APOBEC3A (A3A) cytidine deaminase plays a critical role in the induction of C-to-U substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Bioinformatic analysis of the chronological genetic changes in a sequence database indicated that the largest UC-to-UU mutation signature, consistent with APOBEC-recognized nucleotide motifs, was predominant in single-stranded RNA regions of the viral genome. In SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, exogenous expression of A3A but not expression of other APOBEC proteins induced UC-to-UU mutations in viral RNA (vRNA). Additionally, the mutated C bases were often located at the tips in bulge or loop regions in the vRNA secondary structure. Interestingly, A3A mRNA expression was drastically increased by interferons (IFNs) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in epithelial cells derived from the respiratory system, a site of efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, the UC-to-UU mutation rate was increased in SARS-CoV-2 produced from lung epithelial cells treated with IFN-ß and TNF-α, but not from CRISPR/Cas9-based A3A knockout cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that A3A is a primary host factor that drives mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome via RNA editing.","We all thank Dr Klaus Strebel of the National Institutes of Health, USA, for kindly providing the pcDNA A3A (Myc-HIS) plasmid and Dr Terumasa Ikeda of Kumamoto University, Japan, for the pCASSG A1 WT (HA) and pCASSG A1 E63A (HA) plasmids.",,Nucleic Acids Research,,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"0305-1048, 1362-4962","Humans; COVID-19; Cytidine Deaminase; Genome, Viral; Mutation; RNA, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2023-01-05,2023,2023-01-05,2023-01-25,51,2,783-795,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nakata, Yoshihiro; Ode, Hirotaka; Kubota, Mai; Kasahara, Takaaki; Matsuoka, Kazuhiro; Sugimoto, Atsuko; Imahashi, Mayumi; Yokomaku, Yoshiyuki; Iwatani, Yasumasa","Nakata, Yoshihiro (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi 460-0001, Japan; Department of AIDS Research, Division of Basic Medicine, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi 466-8550, Japan); Ode, Hirotaka (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi 460-0001, Japan); Kubota, Mai (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi 460-0001, Japan); Kasahara, Takaaki (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi 460-0001, Japan; Department of Respiratory Medicine, Division of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi 466-8550, Japan); Matsuoka, Kazuhiro (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi 460-0001, Japan); Sugimoto, Atsuko (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi 460-0001, Japan); Imahashi, Mayumi (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi 460-0001, Japan); Yokomaku, Yoshiyuki (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi 460-0001, Japan); Iwatani, Yasumasa (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi 460-0001, Japan; Department of AIDS Research, Division of Basic Medicine, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi 466-8550, Japan)","Iwatani, Yasumasa (Nagoya Medical Center; Nagoya University)","Nakata, Yoshihiro (Nagoya Medical Center; Nagoya University); Ode, Hirotaka (Nagoya Medical Center); Kubota, Mai (Nagoya Medical Center); Kasahara, Takaaki (Nagoya Medical Center; Nagoya University); Matsuoka, Kazuhiro (Nagoya Medical Center); Sugimoto, Atsuko (Nagoya Medical Center); Imahashi, Mayumi (Nagoya Medical Center); Yokomaku, Yoshiyuki (Nagoya Medical Center); Iwatani, Yasumasa (Nagoya Medical Center; Nagoya University)",Nagoya University; Nagoya Medical Center,grid.27476.30; grid.410840.9,Nagoya; Nagoya,; ,Japan; Japan,Japan Science and Technology Agency; National Institutes of Health; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development,ICRP - International Cancer Research Partnership; NIH - National Institutes of Health; US Federal Funders,Japan; United States; Japan; Japan,grant.9617394; grant.8428542,20fk0108293h0001; 19H03482,11,11,,,1,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-pdf/51/2/783/48929191/gkac1238.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154327024,31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,Emerging Infectious Diseases; Biotechnology; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Prevention; Pneumonia; Human Genome,,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,,,A01 Clinical Medicine,3 Good Health and Well Being

Traditional wet-lab method requires a lot of money and labor in identifying potential microbe-drug associations. With development of machine learning and publication of large amounts of biological data, computational methods become feasible.
Methods: In this article, we proposed a computational model of neighborhood-based inference (NI) and restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) to predict potential microbe-drug association (NIRBMMDA) by using integrated microbe similarity, integrated drug similarity and known microbe-drug associations. First, NI was used to obtain a score matrix of potential microbe-drug associations by using different thresholds to find similar neighbors for drug or microbe. Second, RBM was employed to obtain another score matrix of potential microbe-drug associations based on contrastive divergence algorithm and sigmoid function. Because generalization ability of individual method is poor, we used an ensemble learning to integrate two score matrices for predicting potential microbe-drug associations more accurately. In particular, NI can fully utilize similar (neighbor) information of drug or microbe and RBM can learn potential probability distribution hid in known microbe-drug associations. Moreover, ensemble learning was used to integrate individual predictor for obtaining a stronger predictor.
Results: In global leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), NIRBMMDA gained the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.8666, 0.9413 and 0.9557 for datasets of DrugVirus, MDAD and aBiofilm, respectively. In local LOOCV, AUCs of 0.8512, 0.9204 and 0.9414 were obtained for NIRBMMDA based on datasets of DrugVirus, MDAD and aBiofilm, respectively. For five-fold cross validation, NIRBMMDA acquired AUC and standard deviation of 0.8569 ± -0.0027, 0.9248 ± -0.0014 and 0.9369 ± -0.0020 on the basis of datasets of DrugVirus, MDAD and aBiofilm, respectively. Moreover, case study for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) showed that 13 out of the top 20 predicted drugs were verified by searching literature. The other two case studies indicated that 17 and 17 out of the top 20 predicted microbes for the drug of ciprofloxacin and minocycline were confirmed by identifying published literature, respectively.",This study is part of Xiao-Long Cheng’s Masters in Computer Science work.,"The authors received the following grants: Scientific Research Foundation of Jiangsu Provincial Education Department: 21KJB520030; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province grant number: BK20220621; 2020 scientific research start-up fund: ZMF20020461; and Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province:KYCX22_3062.

It has been reported that vaccination with a mixture of a viscous base carboxyvinyl polymer (CVP) and viral antigens induced robust systemic and mucosal immune responses. In this study, we analyzed the behavior of immunocompetent cells in the nasal cavity over time by spatial transcriptome profiling induced immediately after antigen vaccination using CVP. We established a method for performing spatial transcriptomics using the Visium system in the mouse nasal cavity and analyzed gene expression profiles within the nasal cavity after intranasal vaccination. Glycoprotein 2 (Gp2)-, SRY-box transcription factor 8 (Sox8)-, or Spi-B transcription factor (Spib)-expressing cells were increased in the nasal passage (NP) region at 3-6 hr after SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and CVP (S-CVP) vaccination. The results suggested that microfold (M) cells are activated within a short period of time (3-6 hr). Subsequent cluster analysis of cells in the nasal cavity showed an increase in Cluster 9 at 3-6 hr after intranasal vaccination with the S-CVP. We found that Il6 in Cluster 9 had the highest log2 fold values within the NP at 3-6 hr. A search for gene expression patterns similar to that of Il6 revealed that the log2 fold values of Edn2, Ccl20, and Hk2 also increased in the nasal cavity after 3-6 hr. The results showed that the early response of immune cells occurred immediately after intranasal vaccination. In this study, we identified changes in gene expression that contribute to the activation of M cells and immunocompetent cells after intranasal vaccination of mice with antigen-CVP using a time-series analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. The results facilitated the identification of the cell types that are activated during the initial induction of nasal mucosal immunity.","We thank Dr. Noriyasu Iwase and Dr. Chiaki Maruyama for assistance with the experiments; Mr. Yasumasa Nishito for measuring the DV200 values; Ms. Asako Takagi for preparation of reagents; Dr. Takahiro Sanada for advice on paper preparation; Mr. Hiromune Miyazaki for assistance with figure creation; and Mr. Yoshinobu Iguchi, Mr. Kazunari Sekiyama, Ms. Hiromi Kondo, and Ms. Mai Kounoe for assistance with preparation of the tissue blocks.","This research was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (Grant No. 21K06981), and the Program for the Promotion of Fundamental Studies in Liver Cirrhosis of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.

Therefore, we evaluated the quality of libraries, efficiency of rRNA depletion, and viral detection sensitivity using a mock community and a melamine-coated table surface RNA with levels below those required (< 5 ng) with a library preparation kit (NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit).ResultsGood-quality RNA libraries were obtained from 0.1 ng of mock community and table surface RNA by changing the adapter concentration and number of PCR cycles. Differences in the target species of the rRNA depletion method affected the community composition and sensitivity of virus detection. The percentage of viral occupancy in two replicates was 0.259 and 0.290% in both human and bacterial rRNA-depleted samples, a 3.4 and 3.8-fold increase compared with that for only bacterial rRNA-depleted samples. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 spiked-in human rRNA and bacterial rRNA-depleted samples suggested that more SARS-CoV-2 reads were detected in bacterial rRNA-depleted samples. We demonstrated that metatranscriptome analysis of RNA viromes is possible from RNA isolated from an indoor surface (representing a built-environment surface) using a standard library preparation kit.",We thank Mr. Reo Itabashi for his assistance with sampling and nucleic acid extraction.

Timeliness, a key metric in epidemic response, can be examined to identify critical steps and delays in public health action.AimTo examine timeliness, we analysed the response to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic, with a focus on the international and One Health response efforts.MethodsWe performed a historical review of the MERS epidemic between September 2012 and January 2019 in three steps: (i) the construction of a timeline identifying critical events in the global response, (ii) the performance of a critical path analysis to define outbreak milestones and (iii) a time gap analysis to measure timeliness in the execution of these milestones.ResultsWe proposed 14 MERS-specific milestones at different phases of the epidemic, assessing timeliness of the public health response as well as at the animal-human interface, where we identified the most significant delays.ConclusionsWhen comparing timeliness across three coronavirus epidemics, i.e. MERS (2012), SARS (2002) and COVID-19 (2019), we identified clear improvements over time for certain milestones including laboratory confirmation and diagnostics development, while this was not as apparent for others, as the identification of zoonotic hosts. To more efficiently respond to emerging threats, the global health community should widely assess and tackle specific delays in implementing response interventions by addressing challenges in the sharing of information, data and resources, as well as efficiency, quality, transparency and reliability of reporting events.","Ethical approval was not necessary for this study as data were not collected from human subjects, but from already published and publicly available literature sources.

9580,pub.1145358760,10.1089/bio.2021.0127,35133889,,,Challenges on the Development of Biodiversity Biobanks: The Living Archives of Biodiversity,"Biodiversity biobanks or ex situ biodiversity biorepositories tend to receive less attention compared with their biomedical counterparts. In this review, we highlight the necessity for these biorepositories by presenting their significant role in health, biodiversity, linking of big data, other translational research, and biodiversity conservation efforts. Moreover, the significant challenges in developing and maintaining biodiversity biobanks based on successful biobanks in some megadiverse developing countries are examined to provide insights into what needs to be done and what can be improved by up-and-coming biodiversity biobanks. These challenges include lack of financial support and political will; availability of experts; development of standard policies; and information management system. In addition, issues regarding access and benefit sharing and Digital Sequence Information must be addressed by biodiversity biobanks.",The authors are grateful to the DOST-SEI Career Incentive Program for the support given to NACA.,"Even with the invaluable bioresources stored in biobanks, securing the necessary financial support for their establishment and long-term sustainability has always been challenging. In an ESBB (European, Middle Eastern and African Society for Biopreservation and Biobanking) conference, researchers claimed that biobanks for nonhuman samples are particularly poorly funded compared with most medical biobanks.6 To properly start and subsequently maintain a biobank, funding sources must be secured to obtain the necessary equipment such as freezers, space for the facility, materials to be used, and salaries for personnel. Aside from the budget needed to start a biobank, its operational and maintenance costs are needed to house large and numerous freezers; system infrastructures; quality control and biosecurity instruments; and the possible scaling-up to cope with the advancement of technology must be taken into consideration.53 Comparing funds allocated for biobanks shows great variability by country. The TWB, for example, has been given a total of $73 million over 6 years by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. On the contrary, the UK Biobank received initial funding of $110 million, and the BioBank Japan received $180 million.54 These three, however, are all biomedical biobanks. On the contrary, minimal information is available on the funding of biobanks for nonhuman samples. From the three biobanks compared in Table 1, only the South Australian Museum (SAM) housing the ABTC provided their funding and expenditures information on their website through their annual reports. However, the actual allotted budget solely for the ABTC was not provided. Various strategies have been employed and suggested to combat this funding problem, including mixed public funding streams.53,54 Different funding sources used for starting biobanks and ensuring their long-term maintenance include federal, state, hospital, university, pharmaceutical, and private institutions.56 A significant deterrent for biodiversity biobanks is the lack of major commercial incentives or future profits that entice funding.15 On the contrary, human biobanks are more appealing to be funded by pharmaceutical or other private institutions. Acquiring wildlife and their biospecimens for profit-related purposes is also subject to legal issues, especially for endangered species. Therefore, supporting biodiversity biobanks must generally be for preserving biodiversity and research purposes and not for profit.22 Although this limits the potential of funding from private institutions, it also calls for governments to invest in building more nonhuman biobanking capacity in their countries for their biodiversity conservation. Based on Table 1, all three biobanks get the majority of their funds from their respective governments. Since SAM houses ABTC, it also acquires funds from museum fees and earnings. Access to the specimens stored in it would also require a minimal fee to cover the operational cost of maintaining and retrieving the specimen. However, this fee does not charge for the actual value of the specimen since State and Federal laws prohibit the trade of wildlife species commercially.52 Having biodiversity biobanks directly linked or under existing national museums, like ABTC, may be a good solution to sustain these biobanks since this could provide more funding sources. Examples of famous biobank initiatives for endangered species are the Frozen Ark in the United Kingdom and Nature's SAFE Living Biobank in Europe. Both initiatives accept donations to secure funding for their future operations since the grants they receive are proving to be insufficient. They aim to preserve genetic material from species facing extinction, and ironically, they seem to be at risk due to the high costs of maintaining their operations.56,57 Political will must also be encouraged to support biodiversity biobanks, especially in MDCs where critical taxonomic assessments show the necessities of biodiversity infrastructures such as biobanks. Biodiversity experts must inform policymakers through discussions in order for them to feel the sense of urgency in protecting their country's biodiversity as a response to the ongoing biodiversity crisis. Public awareness and calls for immediate action with these topics may also help increasing political will to invest in biodiversity projects. There must then be a culture in which biodiversity samples are treated as a national asset or wealth that must be inherently conserved by governments and not just an afterthought that receives research grants from time to time.12,58 Public biobanks in the East Asian region were mainly reliant on government funding, and therefore heavily influenced by government planning and political will.3 Biobanks in China, Korea, and Japan that receive increased investment from their governments have shown rapid growth compared with neighboring countries. These Asian biobanks must also consider diversifying their fund sources since government funding may only be stable for a defined period. As previously mentioned, the three MDCs shown in Table 1 represent more biodiversity infrastructures compared with the remaining 14 emerging and developing MDCs combined. Industrialized countries such as Australia, Japan, the EU, and the United States could also support developing countries by providing funds and having research collaborations to prevent massive global biodiversity loss.12 Some leading biobanks are already doing this, like the Frozen Ark that aims to support global animal biobanking efforts by sharing their expertise; and the Smithsonian's Pan-Smithsonian Cryo-Initiative that promotes best practices and standards for biodiversity collections to their stakeholders.22,58,59 A coordinated approach such as this will create a more robust validation for biodiversity biobanks' funding.

However, the players and mechanisms that underlie protease regulation in the intestinal lumen have remained unclear. Here we show that Paraprevotella strains isolated from the faecal microbiome of healthy human donors are potent trypsin-degrading commensals. Mechanistically, Paraprevotella recruit trypsin to the bacterial surface through type IX secretion system-dependent polysaccharide-anchoring proteins to promote trypsin autolysis. Paraprevotella colonization protects IgA from trypsin degradation and enhances the effectiveness of oral vaccines against Citrobacter rodentium. Moreover, Paraprevotella colonization inhibits lethal infection with murine hepatitis virus-2, a mouse coronavirus that is dependent on trypsin and trypsin-like proteases for entry into host cells4,5. Consistently, carriage of putative genes involved in trypsin degradation in the gut microbiome was associated with reduced severity of diarrhoea in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, trypsin-degrading commensal colonization may contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and protection from pathogen infection.","We thank P. D. Burrows for comments; S.

However, laboratory-based research projects were not possible during COVID-19. Instead, we used open datasets to provide computational research projects in metagenomics to biochemistry undergraduates (80 students with limited computing experience). We aimed to give the students a chance to explore any dataset, rather than use a small number of artificial datasets (~60 published datasets were used). To achieve this, we utilized Google Colaboratory (Colab), a virtual computing environment. Colab was used as a framework to retrieve raw sequencing data (analyzed with QIIME2) and generate visualizations. Setting up the environment requires no prior experience; all students have the same drive structure and notebooks can be shared (for synchronous sessions). We also used the platform to combine multiple datasets, perform a meta-analysis, and allowed the students to analyze large datasets with 1000s of subjects and factors. Projects that required increased computational resources were integrated with Google Cloud Compute. In future, all research projects can include some aspects of reanalyzing public data, providing students with data science experience. Colab is also an excellent environment in which to develop data skills in multiple languages (e.g., Perl, Python, Julia).",The authors thank the QIIME2 developers for providing a platform to analyze microbiome data and also providing many highly detailed examples in the QIIME2 documentation.

Although molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet urgently needed. Validated serologic assays are needed for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir, and epidemiologic studies. We developed serologic assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike protein-specific, and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies. Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrated that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected persons seroconverted by 2 weeks after disease onset. We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity, and sensitivity varied between the 2 assays; the IgA ELISA showed higher sensitivity. Overall, the validated assays described can be instrumental for detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiologic, and vaccine evaluation studies.","We thank Malik Peiris for providing serum samples from SARS patients.

We investigated SARS-CoV-2 exposure at a childcare center in South Korea. A 4-year-old child, probably infected by his grandmother, attended the center during the presymptomatic period (February 19-21, 2020). Fever developed on February 22, and he was given a diagnosis SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 27. At the center, 190 persons (154 children and 36 adults) were identified as contacts; 44 (23.2%) were defined as close contacts (37 children and 7 adults). All 190 persons were negative for SARS-CoV-2 on days 8-9 after the last exposure. Two close contacts (1 child and 1 adult) showed development of symptoms on the last day of quarantine. However, subsequent test results were negative. This investigation adds indirect evidence of low potential infectivity in a childcare setting with exposure to a presymptomatic child.","We thank the children, their parents, childcare staff, and public health officials in Miryang-si and Gyeongsangnam-do for their cooperation and Kyong Ran Peck for discussions and critical feedback.",,Emerging Infectious Diseases,,,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),"1080-6040, 1080-6059","Adult; COVID-19; Child Day Care Centers; Child, Preschool; Contact Tracing; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Quarantine; Republic of Korea; SARS-CoV-2",2020-11-30,2020,2020-11-30,2021-02,27,2,341-347,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yoon, Yoonsun; Choi, Gwang-Jun; Kim, Ji Yeong; Kim, Kyung-Ran; Park, Hwanhee; Chun, Jae Kyung; Kim, Yae-Jean","Yoon, Yoonsun (Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea (Y.

With reference to the concept of One Digital Health (ODH), this paper considers how digital capabilities can help to overcome 'operational brakes' in OH through new and deeper insights, better predictions, and more targeted or precise preventive strategies and public health countermeasures. However, the data landscape is fragmented and access to certain types of data is increasingly restrictive as individuals, communities and countries seek to assert greater control over data taken from them. This paper proposes for a dedicated global ODH framework-centered on fairness and equity-to be established to promote data-sharing across all the key knowledge domains of OH and to devise data-driven solutions to challenges in the human-animal-ecosystems interface. It first considers the data landscape in relation to: (1) Human and population health; (2) Pathogens; (3) Animal and plant health; and (4) Ecosystems and biodiversity. The complexification from the application of advance genetic sequencing technology is then considered, with focus on current debates over whether certain types of data like digital (genetic) sequencing information (DSI) should remain openly and freely accessible. The proposed ODH framework must augment the existing access and benefit sharing (ABS) framework currently prescribed under the Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in at least three different ways. First, the ODH framework should apply to all genetic resources and data, including DSI, whether from humans or non-humans. Second, the FAIRER principles should be implemented, with focus on fair and equitable benefit-sharing. Third, the ODH framework should adopt multilateral approaches to data sharing (such as through federated data systems) and to ABS. By operationalizing OH as ODH, we are more likely to be able to protect and restore natural habitats, secure the health and well-being of all living things, and thereby realize the goals set out in the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework under the CBD.",,"This work was supported by a grant on health care digitalization from the WYNG Foundation, Hong Kong SAR.",Frontiers in Public Health,,,Frontiers,2296-2565,Artificial Intelligence; Biodiversity; Digital Technology; Ecosystem; One Health,2022-05-03,2022,2022-05-03,,10,,768977,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ho, Calvin Wai-Loon","Ho, Calvin Wai-Loon (Department of Law and Centre for Medical Ethics and Law, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR, China)","Ho, Calvin Wai-Loon (University of Hong Kong)","Ho, Calvin Wai-Loon (University of Hong Kong)",University of Hong Kong,grid.194645.b,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,China,,,,,,3,3,,,10,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.768977/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147552704,4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health; 42 Health Sciences,,Generic health relevance,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,15 Life on Land; 3 Good Health and Well Being

Were you successful? Here, we reveal that metagenomes from no fewer than 20% of the papers found in our literature search, published between 2016 and 2019, were not deposited in a repository or were simply inaccessible. The proportion of inaccessible data within the literature has been increasing year-on-year. Noncompliance with Open Data is best predicted by the scientific discipline of the journal. The number of citations, journal type (e.g., Open Access or subscription journals), and publisher are not good predictors of data accessibility. However, many publications in high-impact factor journals do display a higher likelihood of accessible metagenomic data sets. Twenty-first century science demands compliance with the ethical standard of data sharing of metagenomes and DNA sequence data more broadly. Data accessibility must become one of the routine and mandatory components of manuscript submissions-a requirement that should be applicable across the increasing number of disciplines using metagenomics. Compliance must be ensured and reinforced by funders, publishers, editors, reviewers, and, ultimately, the authors.","The authors received no specific funding for this work.

We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a newly developed quantitative species-specific TTV-PCR (ssTTV-PCR) method to identify the etiology of KD. We applied ssTTV-PCR to samples collected from 11 KD patients and 22 matched control subjects who participated in our previous prospective study. We used the NGS dataset from the previous study to validate ssTTV-PCR. The TTV loads in whole blood and nasopharyngeal aspirates correlated highly (Spearman's R = 0.8931, p < 0.0001, n = 33), supporting the validity of ssTTV-PCR. The ssTTV-PCR and NGS results were largely consistent. However, inconsistencies occurred when ssTTV-PCR was more sensitive than NGS, when the PCR primer sequences mismatched the viral sequences in the participants, and when the NGS quality score was low. Interpretation of NGS requires complex procedures. ssTTV-PCR is more sensitive than NGS but may fail to detect a fast-evolving TTV species. It would be prudent to update primer sets using NGS data. With this precaution, ssTTV-PCR can be used reliably in a future large-scale etiological study for KD.",We are grateful to Lisa Macera and Mariko Isshiki for their assistance.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,,MDPI,"1661-6596, 1422-0067",Humans; Torque teno virus; Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Prospective Studies; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing,2023-05-12,2023,2023-05-12,,24,10,8674,All OA; Gold,Article,"Spezia, Pietro Giorgio; Filippini, Fabio; Nagao, Yoshiro; Sano, Tetsuya; Ishida, Takafumi; Maggi, Fabrizio","Spezia, Pietro Giorgio (Department of Translational Research, University of Pisa, 56127 Pisa, Italy); Filippini, Fabio (Department of Translational Research, University of Pisa, 56127 Pisa, Italy); Nagao, Yoshiro (Department of Paediatrics, Japan Community Health Care Organisation Osaka Hospital, Osaka 5530003, Japan; Department of Paediatrics, Fukuoka Tokushukai Hospital, Fukuoka 8160864, Japan); Sano, Tetsuya (Department of Paediatrics, Japan Community Health Care Organisation Osaka Hospital, Osaka 5530003, Japan); Ishida, Takafumi (Department of Biological Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan); Maggi, Fabrizio (Laboratory of Virology, National Institute for Infectious Diseases “Lazzaro Spallanzani”—IRCCS, 00149 Rome, Italy)","Nagao, Yoshiro (Osaka Hospital; Fukuoka Tokushukai Hospital)","Spezia, Pietro Giorgio (University of Pisa); Filippini, Fabio (University of Pisa); Nagao, Yoshiro (Osaka Hospital; Fukuoka Tokushukai Hospital); Sano, Tetsuya (Osaka Hospital); Ishida, Takafumi (University of Tokyo); Maggi, Fabrizio (Istituto Nazionale per le Malattie Infettive Lazzaro Spallanzani)",University of Pisa; University of Tokyo; Fukuoka Tokushukai Hospital; Istituto Nazionale per le Malattie Infettive Lazzaro Spallanzani; Osaka Hospital,grid.5395.a; grid.26999.3d; grid.415151.5; grid.419423.9; grid.460257.2,Pisa; Tokyo; Fukuoka; Rome; Osaka,Toscana; ; ; ; ,Italy; Japan; Japan; Italy; Japan,,,,,,0,0,,,1,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/10/8674/pdf?version=1683890768,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158010977,3107 Microbiology; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 31 Biological Sciences,Clinical Research,,4.1 Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies,,,A01 Clinical Medicine,

It has the capability of exploring and identifying the most potent vaccine candidate in a limited period of time. The first successful novel approach of reverse vaccinology was observed in Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B, which has revolutionised the whole field of computational biology. In this review, we have summarized the application of reverse vaccinology for different infectious diseases, discussed epitope prediction and various available bioinformatic tools, and explored the advantages, limitations and necessary elements of this approach. Some of the modifications in the reverse vaccinology approach, like pan-genome and comparative reverse vaccinology, are also outlined. Vaccines for illnesses like AIDS and hepatitis C have not yet been developed. Computer Aided Reverse vaccinology has the potential to be a game-changer in this area. The use of computational tools, pipelines and advanced soft-computing methods, such as artificial intelligence and deep learning, and exploitation of available omics data in integration have paved the way for speedy and effective vaccine designing. Is reverse vaccinology a viable option for developing vaccines against such infections, or is it a myth? Vaccine development gained momentum after the spread of various infections, resulting in numerous deaths; these vaccines are developed using the traditional technique, which includes inactivated microorganisms. As a result, reverse vaccinology may be a far superior technique for creating an effective vaccine.","The authors are thankful to the Department of Biotechnology, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, India, for providing the necessary support.",None.,Combinatorial Chemistry & High Throughput Screening,,,Bentham Science Publishers,"1386-2073, 1875-5402",Artificial Intelligence; Vaccinology; Vaccines; Computational Biology; Computers; Vaccine Development,2023-01-01,2023,2023-01-01,2023,26,10,1813-1821,Closed,Article,"Srivastava, Poornima; Jain, Chakresh Kumar","Srivastava, Poornima (Department of Biotechnology, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, A-10, Sector -62 Noida, Uttar Pradesh, 201307, India); Jain, Chakresh Kumar (Department of Biotechnology, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, A-10, Sector -62 Noida, Uttar Pradesh, 201307, India)","Jain, Chakresh Kumar (Jaypee Institute of Information Technology)","Srivastava, Poornima (Jaypee Institute of Information Technology); Jain, Chakresh Kumar (Jaypee Institute of Information Technology)",Jaypee Institute of Information Technology,grid.419639.0,Noida,Uttar Pradesh,India,,,,,,0,0,,,1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151501936,3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry; 34 Chemical Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences,Biotechnology; Infectious Diseases; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Immunization; Prevention; Vaccine Related,Infection,3.4 Vaccines,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,3 Good Health and Well Being

Comprehensive reference genome annotation for both mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is crucial for developing animal models using this species. In the current study, we collected a total of 234 high-quality RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets and two long-read isoform sequencing (ISO-seq) datasets and improved the annotation of our previously assembled high-quality chromosome-level tree shrew genome. We obtained a total of 3 514 newly annotated coding genes and 50 576 lncRNA genes. We also characterized the tissue-specific expression patterns and alternative splicing patterns of mRNAs and lncRNAs and mapped the orthologous relationships among 11 mammalian species using the current annotated genome. We identified 144 tree shrew-specific gene families, including interleukin 6 (IL6) and STT3 oligosaccharyltransferase complex catalytic subunit B (STT3B), which underwent significant changes in size. Comparison of the overall expression patterns in tissues and pathways across four species (human, rhesus monkey, tree shrew, and mouse) indicated that tree shrews are more similar to primates than to mice at the tissue-transcriptome level. Notably, the newly annotated purine rich element binding protein A (PURA) gene and the STT3B gene family showed dysregulation upon viral infection. The updated version of the tree shrew genome annotation (KIZ version 3: TS_3.0) is available at http://www.treeshrewdb.org and provides an essential reference for basic and biomedical studies using tree shrew animal models.","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1902215 to Y.G.Y. and 31970542 to Y.F.), Chinese Academy of Sciences (Light of West China Program xbzg-zdsys-201909 to Y.G.Y.), and Yunnan Province (202001AS070023 and 2018FB046 to D.D.Y. and 202002AA100007 to Y.G.Y.)",,动物学研究,,,Zoological Research,2095-8137,"Animals;

Recently, coronavirus disease-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) has been detected through rapid reports, primarily from centers in Europe. We provide a case series of CAPA, adding 20 cases to the literature, with review of pathophysiology, diagnosis, and outcomes. The syndromes of pulmonary aspergillosis complicating severe viral infections are distinct from classic invasive aspergillosis, which is recognized most frequently in persons with neutropenia and in other immunocompromised persons. Combined with severe viral infection, aspergillosis comprises a constellation of airway-invasive and angio-invasive disease and results in risks associated with poor airway fungus clearance and killing, including virus- or inflammation-associated epithelial damage, systemic immunosuppression, and underlying lung disease. Radiologic abnormalities can vary, reflecting different pathologies. Prospective studies reporting poor outcomes in CAPA patients underscore the urgent need for strategies to improve diagnosis, prevention, and therapy.","Creation of Figure 3 was supported by Cidara Therapeutics.

Similarly to PD, short-chain fatty acids-producing genera were decreased in DLB. Additionally, Ruminococcus torques and Collinsella were increased in DLB, which were not changed in PD. Random forest models to differentiate DLB and PD showed that high Ruminococcus torques and high Collinsella, which presumably increase intestinal permeability, as well as low Bifidobacterium, which are also observed in Alzheimer’s disease, were predictive of DLB. As Ruminococcus torques and Collinsella are also major secondary bile acids-producing bacteria, we quantified fecal bile acids and found that the production of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was high in DLB. Increased UDCA in DLB may mitigate neuroinflammation at the substantia nigra, whereas neuroinflammation may not be critical at the neocortex. Theraeutic intervention to increase Bifidobacteirum and its metabolites may retard the development and progression of DLB.","We acknowledge Keiichi Takimoto, Keigo Otsuka, Karin Ozeki, Harumi Kodama, and Tomomi Yamada at the Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine for their technical assistance.

There is a paucity of information on HBV MTCT in Cambodia. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women and its MTCT rate in Siem Reap, Cambodia.MethodsThis longitudinal study included two parts, study-1 to screen HBsAg among pregnant women and study-2 to follow up babies of all HBsAg-positive and one-fourth of HBsAg-negative mothers at their delivery and six-month post-partum. Serum or dried blood spot (DBS) samples were collected to examine HBV sero-markers by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA), and molecular analyses were performed on HBsAg-positive samples. Structured questionnaires and medical records were used to examine the risk factors for HBV infection. MTCT rate was calculated by HBsAg positivity of 6-month-old babies born to HBsAg-positive mothers and ascertained by the homology of HBV genomes in mother–child pair at 6-month-old.ResultsA total of 1,565 pregnant women were screened, and HBsAg prevalence was 4.28% (67/1565). HBeAg positivity was 41.8% and was significantly associated with high viral load (p < 0.0001). Excluding subjects who dropped out due to restrictions during COVID-19, one out of 35 babies born to HBsAg-positive mothers tested positive for HBsAg at 6 months of age, despite receiving timely HepB birth dose and HBIG, followed by 3 doses of HepB vaccine. Hence the MTCT rate was 2.86%. The mother of the infected baby was positive for HBeAg and had a high HBV viral load (1.2 × 109 copies/mL). HBV genome analysis showed 100% homology between the mother and the child.ConclusionsOur findings illustrate the intermediate endemicity of HBV infection among pregnant women in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Despite full HepB vaccination, a residual risk of HBV MTCT was observed. This finding supports the recently updated guidelines for the prevention of HBV MTCT in 2021, which integrated screening and antiviral prophylaxis for pregnant women at risk of HBV MTCT. Furthermore, we strongly recommend the urgent implementation of these guidelines nationwide to effectively combat HBV in Cambodia.","Our thanks will go to all women and their babies for their active participation in this study.

Evaluating the effectiveness of EWARS systems is critical to ensuring global health security. We describe the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) global COVID-19 EWARS (CDC EWARS) system and the resources CDC used to gather, manage, and analyze publicly available data during the prepandemic period. We evaluated data quality and validity by measuring reporting completeness and compared these with data from Johns Hopkins University, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and indicator-based data from the World Health Organization. CDC EWARS was integral in guiding CDC's early COVID-19 response but was labor-intensive and became less informative as case-level data decreased and the pandemic evolved. However, CDC EWARS data were similar to those reported by other organizations, confirming the validity of each system and suggesting collaboration could improve EWARS systems during future pandemics.","We thank the members of the CDC COVID-19 International Task Force, Modeling Team, and Global Migration Task Force; CDC Country Offices and field staff; ministries of health of affected countries; World Health Organization; and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.",,Emerging Infectious Diseases,,,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),"1080-6040, 1080-6059","United States; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.; World Health Organization; Global Health",2022-10,2022,,2022-10,28,13,s8-s16,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ricks, Philip M.; Njie, Gibril J.; Dawood, Fatimah S.; Blain, Amy E.; Winstead, Alison; Popoola, Adebola; Jones, Cynthia; Li, Chaoyang; Fuller, James; Anantharam, Puneet; Olson, Natalie; Walker, Allison Taylor; Biggerstaff, Matthew; Marston, Barbara J.; Arthur, Ray R.; Bennett, Sarah D.; Moolenaar, Ronald L.","Ricks, Philip M.

During the first epidemic wave in the country, 187 cases were reported between March 3 and April 22, 2020. Large-scale testing and thorough contact tracing were implemented early on, along with lockdown measures. Transmission chains were mapped through patient history and knowledge of contact with prior cases. The most common reported COVID-19 symptoms were fever, headache, and cough, but 11.2% of cases were asymptomatic. Among 187 cases, 8 patients were admitted to hospitals but none were admitted to intensive care units and no deaths occurred. Superspreading was evident during the epidemic because most secondary cases were attributed to just 3 infectors. Even with the high incidence rate in early March, the Faroe Islands successfully eliminated the first wave of COVID-19 through the early use of contact tracing, quarantine, social distancing, and large-scale testing.","We thank the doctors in the COVID-19 task force for collecting data and Lív Joensen for proofreading and editing the manuscript.

One patient who died also had increased levels of anti-envelope protein IgM. CSF analysis also showed markedly increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10, but severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was not identified in any CSF sample.

Although plagued by high disease burdens, until recently the continent has largely been excluded from biomedical studies. Along with limitations in research and clinical infrastructure, human capacity, and funding, this omission has resulted in an underrepresentation of African data and disadvantaged African scientists. This review interrogates the relative abundance of biomedical data from Africa, primarily in genomics and other omics. The visibility of African science through publications is also discussed. A challenge encountered in this review is the relative lack of annotation of data on their geographical or population origin, with African countries represented as a single group. In addition to the abovementioned limitations,the global representation of African data may also be attributed to the hesitation to deposit data in public repositories. Whatever the reason, the disparity should be addressed, as African data have enormous value for scientists in Africa and globally.",We would like to acknowledge Dhriti Sengupta and colleagues for their work in collecting the data used to generate the map in Figure 4.

METHODS: We analyzed epidemiologic data of returned travelers with enteric fever from 2005-2019. We also analyzed 193 Salmonella Paratyphi A isolates, including 121 isolates with published genomes.
RESULTS: Annual notification trends showed a rapid increase in Salmonella Paratyphi A infection in travelers returning from Myanmar in 2015: 2-4 cases/100,000 travelers in 2012-2014 and 13 cases/100,000 travelers in 2015 (P <0.001). The genomic analyses revealed that 11 Myanmar-related isolates in 2015 formed a tight cluster in clade 3 with a single nucleotide variant (SNV) distance of 0-11 (primarily 0-7), yielding a wider SNV range than outbreak-associated isolates from Cambodia in 2013 (0-6 SNVs) or China in 2010 (0-5 SNVs). Although all Cambodia-related isolates in 2013 harbored the wild-type gyrA sequence, all Myanmar-related isolates in 2015 had a single, identical mutation (Ser83Phe) in the gyrA gene.
CONCLUSION: The epidemiologic and molecular investigations suggested an increase in the infection rate with genetically closely related Salmonella Paratyphi A in travelers returning from Myanmar in 2015. Careful monitoring of the infection in Myanmar as an endemic country is warranted, considering the resumption of cross-border travel during the COVID-19 pandemic.","We thank all municipal and prefectural public health institutes in Japan for providing the Salmonella Paratyphi A isolates.

However, our understanding of the interaction between HSV-1 and human host factors remains incomplete. Here, to identify the host factors for HSV-1 infection, we performed a human genome-wide CRISPR screen using near-haploid HAP1 cells, in which gene knockout (KO) could be efficiently achieved. Along with several already known host factors, we identified 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate synthase 1 (PAPSS1) as a host factor for HSV-1 infection. The KO of PAPSS1 in HAP1 cells reduced heparan sulfate (HepS) expression, consequently diminishing the binding of HSV-1 and several other HepS-dependent viruses (such as HSV-2, hepatitis B virus, and a human seasonal coronavirus). Hence, our findings provide further insights into the host factor requirements for HSV-1 infection and HepS biosynthesis.","The authors thank Christoph Seeger (Fox Chase Cancer Center, USA) for HepAD38 cells; Hiroyuki Miyoshi (RIKEN, Japan), Feng Zhang (Broad Institute, USA), Dider Trono (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland), Yasuo Ariumi (Kumamoto University, Japan), and Bob Weinberg (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, USA) for plasmids; Tetsuya Okajima and Yasuyuki Miyake (Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan) for valuable discussion; Ken Sago, Daisuke Sasaki, Sho Suzuki, and Tomoko Kunogi (Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan) for technical assistance; and the Division for Medical Research Engineering at the Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine for FACS analysis.

One crucial element of an agreement is the question of whether and how digital sequence information (DSI) is subject to access and benefit-sharing from the utilization of genetic resources, one main instrument of the CBD. In the EU, the Open Data Directive (ODD) of 2019 and the recently adopted Data Governance Act (DGA) already cover research data and to some extent DSI. An analysis of the ODD and the DGA throws a spotlight on the legal uncertainty of utilizing DSI and reveals systemic tensions between open data principles and benefit-sharing restrictions on non-commercial use. It also suggests that a future benefit-sharing mechanism for DSI should avoid distinguishing between commercial and non-commercial use upstream, but should instead favor a solution, which imposes benefit-sharing obligations further downstream or outside of the DSI life cycle.","The authors wish to thank the two reviewers, the editors, and Prof. Dr. Herbert Zech for the many insightful comments that greatly improved the manuscript.

Nucleotide sequence databases play an important role in providing meaningful genomic information on a variety of biological organisms.ResultsThe getSequenceInfo software tool allows to access sequence information from various public repositories (GenBank, RefSeq, and the European Nucleotide Archive), and is compatible with different operating systems (Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows) in a programmatic way (command line) or as a graphical user interface. getSequenceInfo or gSeqI v1.0 should help users to get some information on queried sequences that could be useful for specific studies (e.g. the country of origin/isolation or the release date of queried sequences). Queries can be made to retrieve sequence data based on a given kingdom and species, or from a given date. This program allows the separation between chromosomes and plasmids (or other genetic elements/components) by arranging each component in a given folder. Some basic statistics are also performed by the program (such as the calculation of GC content for queried assemblies). An empirically designed nucleotide ratio is calculated using nucleotide information in order to tentatively provide a “NucleScore” for studied genome assemblies. Besides the main gSeqI tool, other additional tools have been developed to perform various tasks related to sequence analysis.ConclusionThe aim of this study is to democratize the use of public repositories in programmatic ways, and to facilitate sequence data analysis in a pedagogical perspective. Output results are available in FASTA, FASTQ, Excel/TSV or HTML formats.

Conventional detection of HIV-1 RFs requires pretreatments, i.e., cloning or single-genome amplification, to distinguish them from dual- or multiple-infection variants. However, these processes are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Here, we constructed a new nanopore sequencing-based platform that enables us to obtain distinctive genetic information for intersubtype RFs and dual-infection HIV-1 variants by using amplicons of HIV-1 near-full-length genomes or two overlapping half-length genome fragments. Repeated benchmark tests of HIV-1 proviral DNA revealed consensus sequence inference with a reduced error rate, allowing us to obtain sufficiently accurate sequence data. In addition, we applied the platform for sequence analyses of 9 clinical samples with suspected HIV-1 RF infection or dual infection according to Sanger sequencing-based genotyping tests for HIV-1 drug resistance. For each RF infection case, replicated analyses involving our nanopore sequencing-based platform consistently produced long consecutive analogous consensus sequences with mosaic genomic structures consisting of two different subtypes. In contrast, we detected multiple heterologous sequences in each dual-infection case. These results demonstrate that our new nanopore sequencing platform is applicable to identify the full-length HIV-1 genome structure of intersubtype RFs as well as dual-infection heterologous HIV-1. Since the genetic diversity of HIV-1 continues to gradually increase, this system will help accelerate full-length genome analysis and molecular epidemiological surveillance for HIV-1. IMPORTANCE HIV-1 is characterized by large genetic differences, including HIV-1 recombinant forms (RFs). Conventional genetic analyses require time-consuming pretreatments, i.e., cloning or single-genome amplification, to distinguish RFs from dual- or multiple-infection cases. In this study, we developed a new analytical system for HIV-1 sequence data obtained by nanopore sequencing. The error rate of this method was reduced to ~0.06%. We applied this system for sequence analyses of 9 clinical samples with suspected HIV-1 RF infection or dual infection, which were extracted from 373 cases of HIV patients based on our retrospective analysis of HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping test results. We found that our new nanopore sequencing platform is applicable to identify the full-length HIV-1 genome structure of intersubtype RFs as well as dual-infection heterologous HIV-1. Our protocol will be useful for epidemiological surveillance to examine HIV-1 transmission as well as for genotypic tests of HIV-1 drug resistance in clinical settings.","This work was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (general) (grant no. 19H03482 and 22H02882 to Y.I.) and by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) Research Project on AIDS/HIV (21fk0410033s0302 led by Hirofumi Akari, Kyoto University, Japan).

However, a rotavirus vaccine has not been included in the national vaccination program. To date, only two studies have been carried out in the state of Sabah, Malaysia, although children in this state are at risk of diarrheal diseases. Previous studies showed that 16%–17% of cases of diarrhea were caused by rotaviruses and that equine-like G3 rotavirus strains are predominant. Because the prevalence of rotaviruses and their genotype distribution vary over time, this study was conducted at four government healthcare facilities from September 2019 through February 2020. Our study revealed that the proportion of rotavirus diarrhea increased significantly to 37.2% (51/137) after the emergence of the G9P[8] genotype in replacement of the G12P[8] genotype. Although equine-like G3P[8] strains remain the predominant rotaviruses circulating among children, the Sabahan G9P[8] strain belonged to lineage VI and was phylogenetically related to strains from other countries. A comparison of the Sabahan G9 strains with the G9 vaccine strains used in the RotaSiil and Rotavac vaccines revealed several mismatches in neutralizing epitopes, indicating that these vaccines might not be effective in Sabahan children.

Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radical activity and antioxidant activity, which can be studied in insects by transcriptome analysis. This study aimed to apply a meta-analysis approach to evaluate insect oxidative transcriptomes using publicly available data. We collected oxidative stress response-related RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for a wide variety of insect species, mainly from public gene expression databases, by manual curation. Only RNA-seq data of Drosophila melanogaster were found and were systematically analyzed using a newly developed RNA-seq analysis workflow for species without a reference genome sequence. The results were evaluated by two metric methods to construct a reference dataset for oxidative stress response studies. Many genes were found to be downregulated under oxidative stress and related to organ system process (GO:0003008) and adherens junction organization (GO:0034332) by gene enrichment analysis. A cross-species analysis was also performed. RNA-seq data of Caenorhabditis elegans were curated, since no RNA-seq data of insect species are currently available in public databases.

In fact, the strains used in research are highly susceptible to a wide range of viruses. Accordingly, these strains are subject to plant pathology and plant-microbe interactions. In terms of plant-plant interactions, N. benthamiana is one of the plants that exhibit grafting affinity with plants from different families. Thus, N. benthamiana is a good model for plant biology and has been the subject of genome sequencing analyses for many years. However, N. benthamiana has a complex allopolyploid genome, and its previous reference genome is fragmented into 141,000 scaffolds. As a result, molecular genetic analysis is difficult to perform. To improve this effort, de novo whole-genome assembly was performed in N. benthamiana with Hifi reads, and 1,668 contigs were generated with a total length of 3.1 Gb. The 21 longest scaffolds, regarded as pseudomolecules, contained a 2.8-Gb sequence, occupying 95.6% of the assembled genome. A total of 57,583 high-confidence gene sequences were predicted. Based on a comparison of the genome structures between N. benthamiana and N. tabacum, N. benthamiana was found to have more complex chromosomal rearrangements, reflecting the age of interspecific hybridization. To verify the accuracy of the annotations, the cell wall modification genes involved in grafting were analyzed, which revealed not only the previously indeterminate untranslated region, intron and open reading frame sequences but also the genomic locations of their family genes. Owing to improved genome assembly and annotation, N. benthamiana would increasingly be more widely accessible.","We acknowledge technical assistance by Akiko Watanabe, Takaharu Kimura, Yoshie Kishida, Hisano Tsuruoka, Chiharu Minami, Akiko Komaki, Akiko Obara, Rie Aomiya and Taeko Shibazaki of the Kazusa DNA Research Institute and Miki Matsumoto of Nagoya University.","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (22K06181 to K.K. and Y.N., 20H03273 to K.K. and M.N., 21H00368 and 21H05657 to M.N.); Japan Science and Technology Agency (JPMJTR194G to M.N.); New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (JPNP20004 to M.N.).",Plant and Cell Physiology,,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"0032-0781, 1471-9053","Tobacco; Genes, Plant; Genomics; Genome, Plant",2023-02-09,2023,2023-02-09,2023-03-01,64,2,248-257,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Kurotani, Ken-ichi; Hirakawa, Hideki; Shirasawa, Kenta; Tanizawa, Yasuhiro; Nakamura, Yasukazu; Isobe, Sachiko; Notaguchi, Michitaka","Kurotani, Ken-ichi (Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, 464-8601, Japan); Hirakawa, Hideki (Department of Frontier Research and Development, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, 2-6-7 Kazusa-kamatari, Kisarazu, Chiba, 292-0818, Japan); Shirasawa, Kenta (Department of Frontier Research and Development, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, 2-6-7 Kazusa-kamatari, Kisarazu, Chiba, 292-0818, Japan); Tanizawa, Yasuhiro (Research Organization of Information and Systems, National Institute of Genetics, Yata, Mishima, 411-8540, Japan); Nakamura, Yasukazu (Research Organization of Information and Systems, National Institute of Genetics, Yata, Mishima, 411-8540, Japan); Isobe, Sachiko (Department of Frontier Research and Development, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, 2-6-7 Kazusa-kamatari, Kisarazu, Chiba, 292-0818, Japan); Notaguchi, Michitaka (Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, 464-8601, Japan; Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, 464-8601, Japan)","Isobe, Sachiko (Kazusa DNA Research Institute); Notaguchi, Michitaka (Nagoya University; Nagoya University)","Kurotani, Ken-ichi (Nagoya University); Hirakawa, Hideki (Kazusa DNA Research Institute); Shirasawa, Kenta (Kazusa DNA Research Institute); Tanizawa, Yasuhiro (National Institute of Genetics); Nakamura, Yasukazu (National Institute of Genetics); Isobe, Sachiko (Kazusa DNA Research Institute); Notaguchi, Michitaka (Nagoya University; Nagoya University)",Kazusa DNA Research Institute; National Institute of Genetics; Nagoya University,grid.410858.0; grid.288127.6; grid.27476.30,Kisarazu; Mishima; Nagoya,; ; ,Japan; Japan; Japan,New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,,Japan; Japan; Japan,grant.9188835; grant.9670494; grant.9020953; grant.9531098; grant.9886332; grant.12872446,20H03273; 21H00368; JPMJTR194G; JPNP20004; 21H05657; 22K06181,4,4,,,108,https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article-pdf/64/2/248/49377520/pcac168.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155261686,3108 Plant Biology; 31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; 3105 Genetics,Human Genome; Genetics; Biotechnology,,,,,A05 Biological Sciences,

To translate this resulting state into a causal relationship with a subset of regulatory features, many experiments deploy an array of laboratory assays from multiple modalities. Often, each of these resulting datasets is large, heterogeneous, and noisy. Thus, it is non-trivial to unify these complex datasets into an interpretable phenotype. Although recent methods address this problem with varying degrees of success, they are constrained by their scopes or limitations. Therefore, an important gap in the field is the lack of a universal data harmonizer with the capability to arbitrarily integrate multi-modal datasets.
RESULTS: In this review, we perform a critical analysis of methods with the explicit aim of harmonizing data, as opposed to case-specific integration. This revealed that matrix factorization, latent variable analysis, and deep learning are potent strategies. Finally, we describe the properties of an ideal universal data harmonization framework.
CONCLUSIONS: A sufficiently advanced universal harmonizer has major medical implications, such as (i) identifying dysregulated biological pathways responsible for a disease is a powerful diagnostic tool; (2) investigating these pathways further allows the biological community to better understand a disease's mechanisms; and (3) precision medicine also benefits from developments in this area, particularly in the context of the growing field of selective epigenome editing, which can suppress or induce a desired phenotype.",S.T. acknowledges funding from the Faculty Initiative Fund and Australian Women Research Success Grant at Monash University.

RWD are derived from a variety of patient medical care and health information outside of conventional research data, and include electronic health records, claims data, registry data of disease, drug and device, health check-up data, and more recently, patient information data from wearable devices. They are currently being utilized in various forms for optimal medical care and real-world evidence (RWE) is constructed through a process of hypothesis generation and verification based on the RWD research. Together with classic clinical research and pragmatic trials, RWE shapes the learning healthcare system and contributes to the improvement of medical care. In the cardiovascular medical care of the current super-aged society, the need for a variety of RWE and the research is increasing, since the guidelines established over time and the medical care based on it cannot necessarily be the best in accordance with the current medical situation. In this review, we focus on the RWD and RWE studies in the cardiovascular medical field and outlines their current status in Japan.

To maximize the impact of these genomics studies, it is important that data from biological samples will become publicly available with standardized metadata. The availability of data at public archives provides the hope that greater insights could be obtained through integration with multi-omics data, reproducibility of published studies, or meta-analyses of large diverse datasets. These datasets should include a description of the host, organism, environmental source of the specimen, spatial-temporal information and other relevant metadata, but unfortunately these attributes are often missing and when present, they show inconsistencies in the use of metadata standards and ontologies.ResultsMETAGENOTE (https://metagenote.niaid.nih.gov) is a web portal that greatly facilitates the annotation of samples from genomic studies and streamlines the submission process of sequencing files and metadata to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (Leinonen R, et al, Nucleic Acids Res, 39:D19-21, 2011) for public access. This platform offers a wide selection of packages for different types of biological and experimental studies with a special emphasis on the standardization of metadata reporting. These packages follow the guidelines from the MIxS standards developed by the Genomics Standard Consortium (GSC) and adopted by the three partners of the International Nucleotides Sequencing Database Collaboration (INSDC) (Cochrane G, et al, Nucleic Acids Res, 44:D48-50, 2016) - National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). METAGENOTE then compiles, validates and manages the submission through an easy-to-use web interface minimizing submission errors and eliminating the need for submitting sequencing files via a separate file transfer mechanism.ConclusionsMETAGENOTE is a public resource that focuses on simplifying the annotation and submission process of data with its corresponding metadata. Users of METAGENOTE will benefit from the easy to use annotation interface but most importantly will be encouraged to publish metadata following standards and ontologies that make the public data available for reuse.","Special thanks to Vishal Thovarai from the Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.

However, reproducible re-use and management of sequence datasets and associated metadata remain critical challenges. We created the open source Python package q2-fondue to enable user-friendly acquisition, re-use and management of public sequence (meta)data while adhering to open data principles.
RESULTS: q2-fondue allows fully provenance-tracked programmatic access to and management of data from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Unlike other packages allowing download of sequence data from the SRA, q2-fondue enables full data provenance tracking from data download to final visualization, integrates with the QIIME 2 ecosystem, prevents data loss upon space exhaustion and allows download of (meta)data given a publication library. To highlight its manifold capabilities, we present executable demonstrations using publicly available amplicon, whole genome and metagenome datasets.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: q2-fondue is available as an open-source BSD-3-licensed Python package at https://github.com/bokulich-lab/q2-fondue. Usage tutorials are available in the same repository. All Jupyter notebooks used in this article are available under https://github.com/bokulich-lab/q2-fondue-examples.

Starting with mechanical devices that provided evidence for virus presence in sick hosts, virus discovery gradually transitioned into a sequence-based scientific discipline, which, nowadays, can characterize virus identity and explore viral diversity at an unprecedented resolution and depth. Sequencing technologies are now being used routinely and at ever-increasing scales, producing an avalanche of novel viral sequences found in a multitude of organisms and environments. In this perspective article, we argue that virus discovery has started to undergo another transformation prompted by the emergence of new approaches that are sequence data-centered and primarily computational, setting them apart from previous technology-driven innovations. The data-driven virus discovery approach is largely uncoupled from the collection and processing of biological samples, and exploits the availability of massive amounts of publicly and freely accessible data from sequencing archives. We discuss open challenges to be solved in order to unlock the full potential of data-driven virus discovery, and we highlight the benefits it can bring to classical (mostly molecular) virology and molecular biology in general.","We are grateful to all colleagues in the scientific community who make their sequencing data publicly accessible.

Although photodynamic therapy influences microbiome diversity, the specific effect of violet light irradiation remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the effect of violet light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation on interdental plaque microbiota. Interdental plaque was collected from 12 human subjects, exposed to violet LED irradiation, and cultured in a specialized growth medium. Next-generation sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA genes revealed that α-diversity decreased, whereas β-diversity exhibited a continuous change with violet LED irradiation doses. In addition, we identified several operational taxonomic units that exhibited significant shifts during violet LED irradiation. Specifically, violet LED irradiation led to a significant reduction in the relative abundance of Fusobacterium species, but a significant increase in several species of oral bacteria, such as Veillonella and Campylobacter. Our study provides an overview of oral plaque microbiota changes under violet LED irradiation, and highlights the potential of this method for adjusting the balance of the oral microbiome without inducing antibiotic resistance.","We would like to thank Chiho Mashimo and Hugo Maruyama for advising on this research.

It is developed using OpenStack-based private cloud with various services like keystone for authentication, cinder for block storage, neutron for networking and nova for managing compute instances for the Cloud. GenoVault uses object-based storage, which enables data to be stored as objects instead of files or blocks for faster retrieval from different distributed object nodes. Along with a web-based interface, a JavaFX-based desktop client has also been developed to meet the requirements of large file uploads that are usually seen in NGS datasets. Users can store files in their respective object-based storage areas and the metadata provided by the user during file uploads is used for querying the database. GenoVault repository is designed taking into account future needs and hence can scale both vertically and horizontally using OpenStack-based cloud features. Users have an option to make the data shareable to the public or restrict the access as private. Data security is ensured as every container is a separate entity in object-based storage architecture which is also supported by Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) for data upload and download. The data is uploaded by the user in individual containers that include raw read files (fastq), processed alignment files (bam, sam, bed) and the output of variation detection (vcf). GenoVault architecture allows verification of the data in terms of integrity and authentication before making it available to collaborators as per the user’s permissions. GenoVault is useful for maintaining the organization-wide NGS data generated in various labs which is not yet published and submitted to public repositories like NCBI. GenoVault also provides support to share NGS data among the collaborating institutions. GenoVault can thus manage vast volumes of NGS data on any OpenStack-based private cloud.","The authors acknowledge the Bioinformatics Resources and Application Facility (BRAF) at C-DAC, Pune.

This study aimed to investigate the outbreak and identify the genotype of the mumps virus (MuV) strain that was involved in the outbreak.Main bodyDuring the outbreak, one 21-year-old and four 20-year-old males staying in the same dormitory building were reported to have developed symptoms of mumps. Of these, two students were available during the investigation for sample collection to detect MuV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the 639-bp fragment encompassing the entire small hydrophobic (SH) gene. Nucleotide sequencing of the amplicon and phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining method was performed to determine the MuV genotype. Of the two buccal swab samples, one was positive for MuV. The MuV strain in this sample belonged to genotype F and it was clustered together with genotype F strains from China with 96.84–99.68% nucleotide identity.ConclusionsGenotype F has limited circulation and is endemic in mainland China. Genotype F strains occasionally reported from other countries were epidemiologically linked to China. This study is the first to report a case of genotype F MuV in Malaysia and no epidemiological link could be established with mainland China. The results provide important information that can assist in strategic planning to improve the prevention and control of mumps infection in Malaysia.","The authors wish to thank all members of the Borneo Medical and Health Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sabah for providing technical support during the study.",This study was financially supported by the Launching Grant for Centre of Excellence from Universiti Malaysia Sabah (Number: AM 18006).,Tropical Medicine and Health,,,Springer Nature,"1348-8945, 1349-4147",,2022-03-02,2022,2022-03-02,2022-12,50,1,20,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fong, Siat Yee; Mori, Daisuke; John, Jecelyn Leaslie; Giloi, Nelbon; Jeffree, Mohammad Saffree; Ahmed, Kamruddin","Fong, Siat Yee (Borneo Medical and Health Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Jalan UMS, 88400, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia); Mori, Daisuke (Department of Pathology and Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; Department of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan); John, Jecelyn Leaslie (Borneo Medical and Health Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Jalan UMS, 88400, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia); Giloi, Nelbon (Department of Community and Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia); Jeffree, Mohammad Saffree (Department of Community and Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia); Ahmed, Kamruddin (Borneo Medical and Health Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Jalan UMS, 88400, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; Department of Pathology and Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia)","Ahmed, Kamruddin (Universiti of Malaysia Sabah; Universiti of Malaysia Sabah)","Fong, Siat Yee (Universiti of Malaysia Sabah; Universiti of Malaysia Sabah); Mori, Daisuke (Universiti of Malaysia Sabah; Kyushu University); John, Jecelyn Leaslie (Universiti of Malaysia Sabah); Giloi, Nelbon (Universiti of Malaysia Sabah); Jeffree, Mohammad Saffree (Universiti of Malaysia Sabah); Ahmed, Kamruddin (Universiti of Malaysia Sabah; Universiti of Malaysia Sabah)",Universiti of Malaysia Sabah; Kyushu University,grid.265727.3; grid.177174.3,Kota Kinabalu; Fukuoka,; ,Malaysia; Japan,Universiti of Malaysia Sabah,,Malaysia,,,0,0,,,1,https://tropmedhealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s41182-022-00411-w,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145988855,3207 Medical Microbiology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,Emerging Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Genetics,,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",3 Good Health and Well Being

Wastewater treatment effluent and combined sewer overflows (CSOs) are major sources of antimicrobial resistance in urban rivers. This study aimed to clarify the effect of municipal wastewater treatment effluent and CSO on antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), mobile gene elements, and the microbial community in an urban river. The ARG abundance per 16S-based microbial population in the target river was 0.37-0.54 and 0.030-0.097 during the CSO event and dry weather, respectively. During the CSO event, the antimicrobial resistome in the river shifted toward a higher abundance of ARGs to clinically important drug classes, including macrolide, fluoroquinolone, and β-lactam, whereas ARGs to sulfonamide and multidrug by efflux pump were relatively abundant in dry weather. The abundance of intI1 and tnpA genes were highly associated with the total ARG abundance, suggesting their potential application as an indicator for estimating resistome contamination.

Consequently, CSO not only increases the abundance of ARGs to clinically important antimicrobials but also possibly enhances potential of HGT in urban rivers.","This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI fund (Grant Nos. 19H02272, 21KK0073, 21H03617, 18KK0114), JST MIRAI Program (Grant No. JPMJMI18DC), and ‘Asia-Pacific Researcher Network on Environmental Dimensions of Antimicrobial Resistance (END-AMR-Asia)’ funded by Kurita Water and Environmental Foundation (Grant No. 22T007).

Now, with advancements in genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation, non-model organisms may be studied with the same advanced bioanalytical toolkit as model organisms. Proteomics is one such technique, which classically relies on predicted protein sequences to catalog and measure complex proteomes across tissues and biofluids. Applying proteomics to non-model organisms can advance and accelerate biomimicry studies, biomedical advancements, veterinary medicine, agricultural research, behavioral ecology, and food safety. In this postmodel organism era, we can study almost any species, meaning that many non-model organisms are, in fact, important emerging model organisms. Herein we specifically focus on eukaryotic organisms and discuss the steps to generate sequence databases, analyze proteomic data with or without a database, and interpret results as well as future research opportunities. Proteomics is more accessible than ever before and will continue to rapidly advance in the coming years, enabling critical research and discoveries in non-model organisms that were hitherto impossible.","The graphics in Figure 1 were created specifically for this manuscript by Debbie Maizels.

Oocytes and cumulus cells complexes were collected from slaughterhouse-derived ovaries and cultured on a plastic plate or gel. The gel culture system improved the rate of development to the blastocyst stage. The oocytes that matured on the gel contained high lipid contents and F-actin formation, and the resultant 8-cell stage embryos had low DNA methylation levels compared to their plate counterparts. RNA sequencing of the oocytes and embryos revealed the differentially expressed genes between the gel and plate culture systems, and upstream regulator analysis revealed estradiol and TGFB1 as top activated upstream molecules. The medium of the gel culture system contained higher concentrations of estradiol and TGFB1 than that of the plate cultures system. Supplementation of the maturation medium with either estradiol or TGFB1 resulted in high lipid content in oocytes. In addition, TGFB1 improved the developmental ability of the oocytes and increased F-actin content while reducing DNA methylation levels in the 8-cell stage embryos. In conclusion, the gel culture system is useful for embryo production, potentially through the upregulation of TGFB1.",We thank the Livestock Improvement Association of Japan for providing the ovaries of cows.,This work was supported by JSPS 16K07669.,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,"Isotta Chimenti, Roberto Gaetani",MDPI,"1661-6596, 1422-0067","Animals; Cattle; In Vitro Oocyte Maturation Techniques; Actins; Oocytes; Polysaccharides, Bacterial; Estradiol; Gels; Lipids; Blastocyst",2023-02-09,2023,2023-02-09,,24,4,3508,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hara, Shunsuke; Inoue, Yuki; Aoki, Sogo; Tanaka, Keisuke; Shirasuna, Koumei; Iwata, Hisataka","Hara, Shunsuke (Department of Animal Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture, Setagaya City 156-8502, Japan.); Inoue, Yuki (Department of Animal Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture, Setagaya City 156-8502, Japan.); Aoki, Sogo (Department of Animal Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture, Setagaya City 156-8502, Japan.); Tanaka, Keisuke (Department of Animal Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture, Setagaya City 156-8502, Japan.); Shirasuna, Koumei (Department of Animal Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture, Setagaya City 156-8502, Japan.); Iwata, Hisataka (Department of Animal Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture, Setagaya City 156-8502, Japan.)","Iwata, Hisataka (Tokyo University of Agriculture)","Hara, Shunsuke (Tokyo University of Agriculture); Inoue, Yuki (Tokyo University of Agriculture); Aoki, Sogo (Tokyo University of Agriculture); Tanaka, Keisuke (Tokyo University of Agriculture); Shirasuna, Koumei (Tokyo University of Agriculture); Iwata, Hisataka (Tokyo University of Agriculture)",Tokyo University of Agriculture,grid.410772.7,Tokyo,Tôkyô,Japan,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,,Japan,grant.5912874,16K07669,0,0,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/4/3508/pdf?version=1675943000,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155321946,3107 Microbiology; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 31 Biological Sciences,Biotechnology; Genetics,,,,,"A06 Agriculture, Veterinary and Food Science",

In this study, we isolated a favipiravir-resistant mutant of Junin virus (JUNV), which is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever, and analyzed the antiviral mechanism of favipiravir against JUNV. Two amino acid substitutions, N462D in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and A168T in the glycoprotein precursor GPC, were identified in the mutant. GPC-A168T substitution enhanced the efficiency of JUNV internalization, which explains the robust replication kinetics of the mutant in the virus growth analysis. Although RdRp-N462D substitution did not affect polymerase activity levels in a minigenome system, comparisons of RdRp error frequencies showed that the virus with RdRp-D462 possessed a significantly higher fidelity. Our next generation sequence (NGS) analysis showed a gradual accumulation of both mutations as we passaged the virus in presence of favipiravir. We also provided experimental evidence for the first time that favipiravir inhibited JUNV through the accumulation of transition mutations, confirming its role as a purine analogue against arenaviruses. Moreover, we showed that treatment with a combination of favipiravir and either ribavirin or remdesivir inhibited JUNV replication in a synergistic manner, blocking the generation of the drug-resistant mutant. Our findings provide new insights for the clinical management and treatment of Argentine hemorrhagic fever.","We are grateful to Drs.

Data from various omics sources such as genetics, proteomics, and metabolomics can be integrated to unravel the intricate working of systems biology using machine learning-based predictive algorithms. Machine learning methods offer novel techniques to integrate and analyse the various omics data enabling the discovery of new biomarkers. These biomarkers have the potential to help in accurate disease prediction, patient stratification and delivery of precision medicine. This review paper explores different integrative machine learning methods which have been used to provide an in-depth understanding of biological systems during normal physiological functioning and in the presence of a disease. It provides insight and recommendations for interdisciplinary professionals who envisage employing machine learning skills in multi-omics studies.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The next generation of networks will utilize a wide variety of resources with significant sensing capabilities. Such networks will extend beyond physically linked computers to include multimodal-information from biological, cognitive, semantic, and social networks. This paradigm shift will involve symbiotic networks of smart medical devices, and smart phones or mobile personal computing and communication devices. These devices—and the network—will be constantly sensing, monitoring, and interpreting the environment; this is sometimes referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). We are also witnessing considerable interest in the “Omics” paradigm, which can be viewed as the study of a domain in a massive scale, at different levels of abstraction, in an integrative manner. The IoT revolution, combined with the Omics revolution (genomics and socio-omics or social networks) and artificial intelligence resurgence, will have significant implications for the way health care is delivered in the United States. After discussing a vision for health care in the future, we introduce the P9 health care concept, followed by a discussion of a framework for smart health care. Then, we present a case study and research directions, followed by examples of ongoing work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).","Certain commercial systems are identified in this paper.

In this perspective, we present AnVIL, describe its ecosystem and interoperability with other platforms, and highlight how this platform and associated initiatives contribute to improved genomic data sharing efforts. The AnVIL is a federated cloud platform designed to manage and store genomics and related data, enable population-scale analysis, and facilitate collaboration through the sharing of data, code, and analysis results. By inverting the traditional model of data sharing, the AnVIL eliminates the need for data movement while also adding security measures for active threat detection and monitoring and provides scalable, shared computing resources for any researcher. We describe the core data management and analysis components of the AnVIL, which currently consists of Terra, Gen3, Galaxy, RStudio/Bioconductor, Dockstore, and Jupyter, and describe several flagship genomics datasets available within the AnVIL. We continue to extend and innovate the AnVIL ecosystem by implementing new capabilities, including mechanisms for interoperability and responsible data sharing, while streamlining access management. The AnVIL opens many new opportunities for analysis, collaboration, and data sharing that are needed to drive research and to make discoveries through the joint analysis of hundreds of thousands to millions of genomes along with associated clinical and molecular data types.","This work is dedicated to the late James Peter Taylor, the Ralph S.

4460,pub.1137878529,10.1016/j.cimid.2021.101668,34004508,,,"Outbreak of equine coronavirus infection among riding horses in Tokyo, Japan","In 2020, an outbreak of equine coronavirus (ECoV) infection occurred among 41 horses at a riding stable in Tokyo, Japan. This stable had 16 Thoroughbreds and 25 horses of other breeds, including Andalusians, ponies and miniature horses. Fifteen horses (37 %) showed mild clinical signs such as fever, lethargy, anorexia and diarrhoea, and they recovered within 3 days of onset. A virus neutralization test showed that all 41 horses were infected with ECoV, signifying that 26 horses (63 %) were subclinical. The results suggest that subclinical horses played an important role as spreaders. A genome sequence analysis revealed that the lengths from genes p4.7 to p12.7 or NS2 in ECoV differed from those of ECoVs detected previously, suggesting that this outbreak was caused by a virus different from those that caused previous outbreaks among draughthorses in Japan. Among 30 horses that tested positive by real-time RT-PCR, ECoV shedding periods of non-Thoroughbreds were significantly longer than those of Thoroughbreds. The difference in shedding periods may indicate that some breeds excrete ECoV longer than other breeds and can contribute to the spread of ECoV.","The equine coronavirus NC99 strain was kindly provided by Dr. J.

Many direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) target essential macromolecules involved in the virus' life cycle. Although such DAAs achieve great success in reducing the viral load in genotype 1 infections, other genotypes demonstrate different levels of response. This study focused on mutation sites associated with patients with genotype 4a infections that failed to respond to treatment with sofosbuvir. The genotyping of HCV samples from patients with virological failure, and responder patients, was conducted using Geno2Pheno webserver-based full NS5B sequences. We constructed 3D structural models for all the samples and used structural analysis to investigate the effect of amino acid substitution on the observed resistance to SOF-based treatment, and the docking of sofosbuvir into the active sites of the 10 models was performed. Finally, 10 molecular dynamic (MD) simulation experiments were conducted to compare the stability of the 3D models of the resistant samples against the stability of the 3D models of the responder samples. The results highlighted the presence of HCV subtype 4a in all ten samples; in addition, an amino acid (aa) substitution in the palm region may hinder HCV polymerase activity. In this study, we provide evidence that a mutation in the NS5B gene that induces resistance to sofosbuvir in patients with the S282T/C/R mutant virus is present in the Egyptian population. Overall, the docking and MD results support our findings and highlight the significant impact of the identified mutations on the resistance of HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).",,This research was self-funded.,Microorganisms,,,MDPI,2076-2607,,2022-03-22,2022,2022-03-22,,10,4,679,All OA; Gold,Article,"Shoun, Aly Atef; Abozahra, Rania; Baraka, Kholoud; Mehrez, Mai; Abdelhamid, Sarah M.","Shoun, Aly Atef (Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Sinai University, El Arish 45518, Egypt); Abozahra, Rania (Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Damanhour University, Damanhour 22511, Egypt;, rania.ragab@pharm.dmu.edu.eg, (R.A.);, kholoud.baraka@pharm.dmu.edu.eg, (K.B.);, sara.magdy@pharm.dmu.edu.eg, (S.M.A.)); Baraka, Kholoud (Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Damanhour University, Damanhour 22511, Egypt;, rania.ragab@pharm.dmu.edu.eg, (R.A.);, kholoud.baraka@pharm.dmu.edu.eg, (K.B.);, sara.magdy@pharm.dmu.edu.eg, (S.M.A.)); Mehrez, Mai (National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute (NHTMRI), Cairo 11511, Egypt;, maymehrezmd@yahoo.com); Abdelhamid, Sarah M.

Detailed spectroscopic analyses by MS and NMR, combined with 13C chemical shift comparison with literature values of the related compounds and a synthetic preparation of 1, allowed its first full NMR characterization and identification of 2-quinolone but not 2-quinolinol (2) as the preferred tautomer for this heterocyclic system. While the metal-chelating activity was negligible, compound 1 at 10 μM, a concentration lower than that in liquid production cultures, quenched hydroxy radical-induced chemiluminescence emitted by luminol by 86%. Because some Burkholderia species are pathogenic to plants and animals, the above result suggests that 1 is a potential antioxidant to counteract reactive oxygen species-based immune response in the host organisms.",This work was supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 18K05827 to N.

In contrast to MAIT cells, the function of other MR1-restricted T cell subsets is largely unknown. Here, we report that mice in which a T cell-specific transcription factor, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11B (Bcl11b), was ablated in immature thymocytes (Bcl11b∆iThy mice) develop chronic inflammation. Bcl11b∆iThy mice lack conventional T cells and MAIT cells, whereas CD4+IL-18R+ αβ T cells expressing skewed Traj33 (Jα33)+ T cell receptors (TCR) accumulate in the periphery, which are necessary and sufficient for the pathogenesis. The disorders observed in Bcl11b∆iThy mice are ameliorated by MR1-deficiency, transfer of conventional T cells, or germ-free conditions. We further show the crystal structure of the TCR expressed by Traj33+ T cells expanded in Bcl11b∆iThy mice. Overall, we establish that MR1-reactive T cells have pathogenic potential.","We thank S.

The purpose of this study was to assess potential changes in the oral microbiome of healthy young adults using 16S rRNA-based sequencing. Eleven females (aged 23-36 years) with stable menstrual cycles and without any oral problems were recruited. Saliva samples were collected before brushing every morning during the menstrual period. Based on basal body temperatures, menstrual cycles were divided into four phases, namely the menstrual, follicular, early luteal, and late luteal phases. Our results showed that the follicular phase had a significantly higher abundance ratio of the Streptococcus genus than the early and late luteal phases, whereas the abundance ratios of the Prevotella 7 and Prevotella 6 genera were significantly lower in the follicular phase than those in the early and late luteal phases and that in the early luteal phase, respectively. Alpha diversity by the Simpson index was significantly lower in the follicular phase than that in the early luteal phase, and beta diversity showed significant differences among the four phases. Using the relative abundance data and copy numbers of the 16S rRNA genes in the samples, the bacterial amounts in the four phases were compared, and we observed that the follicular phase had significantly lower amounts of the Prevotella 7 and Prevotella 6 genera than the menstrual and early luteal phase, respectively. These results indicate reciprocal changes with the Streptococcus genus and Prevotella genera, particularly in the follicular phase. In the present study, we showed that the oral microbiome profiles are affected by the menstrual cycles of healthy young adult females.","The authors would like to thank all staffs, students, and volunteers who participated in this research study.

BCoV causing enteric and respiratory disease is widespread in cattle farms worldwide; however, limited information is available regarding the molecular characterization of BCoV because of its large genome size, despite its significant economic impact. This study aimed to better understand the genomic characterization and evolutionary dynamics of BCoV via comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses through whole genome sequence analysis using 67 BCoV isolates collected throughout Japan from 2006 to 2017. On comparing the genomic sequences of the 67 BCoVs, genetic variations were detected in 5 of 10 open reading frames (ORFs) in the BCoV genome. Phylogenetic analysis using whole genomes from the 67 Japanese BCoV isolates in addition to those from 16 reference BCoV strains, revealed the existence of two major genotypes (classical and US wild ruminant genotypes). All Japanese BCoV isolates originated from the US wild ruminant genotype, and they tended to form the same clusters based on the year and farm of collection, not the disease type. Phylogenetic trees on hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE), spike glycoprotein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N) genes and ORF1 revealed clusters similar to that on whole genome, suggesting that the evolution of BCoVs may be closely associated with variations in these genes. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of BCoV S genes including those of European and Asian BCoVs and human enteric coronavirus along with the Japanese BCoVs revealed that BCoVs differentiated into two major types (European and American types). Moreover, the European and American types were divided into eleven and three genotypes, respectively. Our analysis also demonstrated that BCoVs with different genotypes periodically emerged and predominantly circulated within the country.

The spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria has become a serious problem worldwide, making antibiotic selection extremely difficult. Using quantitative metagenomic analysis, we evaluated a commercial multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system (FilmArray™, bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France) for the rapid identification of causative bacteria.
Methods: The cases of 10 patients with acute abdominal infections were enrolled in this retrospective study. There were six cases of perforated peritonitis and four cases of intraabdominal abscess. Fluid collected from the acute surgical abdominal infections were examined.
Results: All specimens tested positive for microorganisms in culture, and six involved two or more microorganisms. Using the multiplex PCR system, nine of ten specimens were found to involve at least one microorganism. One specimen was not included in the multiplex PCR system panel. Nineteen of 21 microorganisms (90.5%) isolated by culture were detected by the multiplex PCR system. Microorganisms with very small numbers of reads (19 reads) were detectable.
Conclusion: This multiplex PCR system showed a high detection rate for causative microorganisms in ascites and intraabdominal abscesses. This system may be suitable as an affordable rapid identification system for causative bacteria in these cases.","The authors wish to express our thank to Masanori Hashino of the Laboratory of Bacterial Genomics, Pathogen Genomics Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases.

Although several induction protocols for autonomic lineages have been reported, the regulatory machinery remains largely undefined, primarily due to the absence of a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism regulating human autonomic induction in vitro. In this study, our objective was to pinpoint key regulatory components using integrated bioinformatics analysis. A protein-protein interaction network construction for the proteins encoded by the differentially expressed genes from our RNA sequencing data, and conducting subsequent module analysis, we identified distinct gene clusters and hub genes involved in the induction of autonomic lineages. Moreover, we analyzed the impact of transcription factor (TF) activity on target gene expression, revealing enhanced autonomic TF activity that could lead to the induction of autonomic lineages. The accuracy of this bioinformatics analysis was corroborated by employing calcium imaging to observe specific responses to certain ANS agonists. This investigation offers novel insights into the regulatory machinery in the generation of neurons in the ANS, which would be valuable for further understanding and precise regulation of autonomic induction and differentiation.","We thank Yutaro Kumagai, Yuma Nihashi, and Yasuko Ozaki for their support and suggestions on bioinformatic analysis and administrative procedures.

First, a scheme to reanalyze individual-level genome sequence data deposited in the Japanese Genotype-phenotype Archive (JGA), a controlled-access database, was established to make allele frequencies publicly available. As more Japanese individual-level genome sequence data are deposited in JGA, the sample size employed in TogoVar is expected to increase, contributing to genetic study as reference data for Japanese populations. Second, public datasets of Japanese and non-Japanese populations were integrated into TogoVar to easily compare allele frequencies in Japanese and other populations. Each variant detected in Japanese populations was assigned a TogoVar ID as a permanent identifier. Third, these variants were annotated with molecular consequence, pathogenicity, and literature information for interpreting and prioritizing variants.

Bacterial colony forming units (CFUs) in the air samples (n = 37) were monitored by recording the environmental changes occurring over time, then determining the presence/absence of correlations among such changes. The bacterial CFUs changed sharply and were significantly correlated with the DNA concentrations, indicating that the captured bacteria made up most of the airborne bacteria. Spearman's rank correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between the bacterial CFU values and some environmental factors (humidity, wind speed, insolation, and 24-h rainfall). Similarly the significant associations of CFU with humidity and wind speed were also found by multiple regression analysis with box-cox transformation. Among our panel of airborne bacteria (952 strains), 70 strains were identified as soil-derived Bacillus via the production of Escherichia coli- and Staphylococcus aureus-growth inhibiting antibiotics and by 16S rDNA typing. Soil-derived protozoa were also isolated from the air samples. We conclude that the airborne bacteria mainly derived from soil can alter in number according to environmental changes. Our sampler, which was created by easy-to-customize 3D printing, is a useful device for understanding the dynamics of live airborne bacteria.","This study was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKEN) (grant number: 20K20613).

The database now contains over 35 000 alleles of the human Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) named by the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System. This complex contains the most polymorphic genes in the human genome and is now considered hyperpolymorphic. The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database provides a stable and user-friendly repository for this information. Uptake of Next Generation Sequencing technology in recent years has driven an increase in the number of alleles and the length of sequences submitted. As the size of the database has grown the traditional methods of accessing and presenting this data have been challenged, in response, we have developed a suite of tools providing an enhanced user experience to our traditional web-based users while creating new programmatic access for our bioinformatics user base. This suite of tools is powered by the IPD-API, an Application Programming Interface (API), providing scalable and flexible access to the database. The IPD-API provides a stable platform for our future development allowing us to meet the future challenges of the HLA field and needs of the community.","The publication of the data online would not be possible without the ongoing support and collaboration of EMBL-EBI who provide the required infrastructure. In particular the Web Production and Infrastructure teams at EMBL-EBI. We would like to thank Prof. Parham, Departments of Structural Biology and Microbiology and Immunology at the Stanford University School of Medicine for continued advice and support. We would like to acknowledge the contributions of the developers of the IPD-MHC and IPD-NHKIR databases whose work has been instrumental to the latest developments of IPD-IMGT/HLA.

However, with the development of sequencing technologies, various commensal microorganisms, especially bacteria, have been observed in the lungs of healthy humans. Several studies have also linked lung microbes to infectious lung diseases. However, few databases have focused on the metagenomics of lungs to provide microbial compositions and corresponding metadata information. Such a database would be handy for researching and treating lung diseases.
Methods: To provide researchers with a preliminary understanding of lung microbes and their research methods, the LDMD collated nearly 10,000 studies in the literature covering over 30 diseases, gathered basic information such as the sources of lung microbe samples, sequencing methods, and processing software, as well as analyzed the metagenomic sequencing characteristics of lung microbes. Besides, the LDMD also contained data collected in our laboratory.
Results: In this study, we established the Lung Disease Microorganisms Database (LDMD), a comprehensive database of microbes involved in lung disease. The LDMD offered sequence analysis capabilities, allowing users to upload their sequencing results, align them with the data collated in the database, and visually analyze the results.
Conclusion: In conclusion, the LDMD possesses various functionalities that provide a convenient and comprehensive resource to study the lung metagenome and treat lung diseases.",,The authors are thankful for the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32270607 and 31871322) and China Mobile (Chengdu) Industrial Research Institute (8531000015).

To investigate the longitudinal transition of the phylogenetic feature of the HCoV-OC43 S gene in a community, phylogenetic analysis of the S1 region of the S gene was conducted using 208 strains detected in Yamagata during 2010 to 2017 with reference strains of the genotype. The S1 sequences were divisible into four groups: A to D. All Yamagata strains belonged to either group B or group D. In group B, 46 (90.2%) out of 51 Yamagata strains were clustered with those of genotype E reference strains (cluster E). In group D, 28 (17.8%) and 122 (77.7%) out of 157 Yamagata strains were clustered, respectively, with genotype F and genotype G reference strains. In cluster G, 28 strains formed a distinct cluster. Monthly distributions of HCoV-OC43 in Yamagata in 2010 to 2017 revealed that group B and group D appeared one after another. In group B, the cluster E strains were prevalent recurrently. In conclusion, epidemics of HCoV-OC43 in Yamagata, Japan might be attributable to two genetically different groups: group B showed a recurrent epidemic of strains belonging to a single phylogenetic cluster and group D showed epidemic strains belonging to multiple clusters.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the medical staff and people of Yamagata prefecture for their collaboration in specimen collection for the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Disease, Japan based on the Infectious Diseases Control Law.

To cope with this data flood, computational approaches, web services, and databases have been implemented to deal with issues such as data integration, visualization, exploration, organization, scalability, and complexity. Nevertheless, as the number of such sets increases, it is becoming more and more difficult for an end user to know what the scope and focus of each repository is and how redundant the information between them is. Several repositories have a more general scope, while others focus on specialized aspects, such as specific organisms or biological systems. Unfortunately, many of these databases are self-contained or poorly documented and maintained. For a clearer view, in this article we provide a comprehensive categorization, comparison and evaluation of such repositories for different bioentity interaction types. We discuss most of the publicly available services based on their content, sources of information, data representation methods, user-friendliness, scope and interconnectivity, and we comment on their strengths and weaknesses.

Bovine IDVs (BIDVs) from Japan have been distributed nationwide since 2010 and are genetically distinct from foreign IDVs. We isolated BIDVs from three BRD outbreaks, in Hokkaido during 2018-2020, to understand their genetic and antigenic characteristics. Retrospective surveillance was performed using sera collected throughout the last decade in Hokkaido to investigate BIDV existence. Three BIDVs were isolated using cell culture. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses using sequence data of the three BIDVs and IDVs from Japan and other countries available in GenBank demonstrated that Japanese BIDVs, including the three BIDV isolates, were genetically distinct from other IDVs. Genotype classifications based on the rotavirus genotype classification revealed multiple genotypes of RNA segments 1-7. Two BIDVs were of a new genotype, different from those of other Japanese BIDVs. Neutralization assays against two BIDVs with different genotypes using sera collected in acute and recovery phases of BRD revealed differences in cross-reactivity to heterogenous BIDVs. Retrospective surveillance suggested that BIDV existed in Hokkaido, in 2009. Our findings suggest that BIDVs of different genotypes and antigenicity are distributed and maintained in Hokkaido and provide new insights into molecular characteristics and the evolution of IDVs.","We thank H.

Here, we present Gene Expression Nebulas (GEN, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gen/), an open-access data portal integrating transcriptomic profiles under various biological contexts. GEN features a curated collection of high-quality bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets by using standardized data processing pipelines and a structured curation model. Currently, GEN houses a large number of gene expression profiles from 323 datasets (157 bulk and 166 single-cell), covering 50 500 samples and 15 540 169 cells across 30 species, which are further categorized into six biological contexts. Moreover, GEN integrates a full range of transcriptomic profiles on expression, RNA editing and alternative splicing for 10 bulk datasets, providing opportunities for users to conduct integrative analysis at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In addition, GEN provides abundant gene annotations based on value-added curation of transcriptomic profiles and delivers online services for data analysis and visualization. Collectively, GEN presents a comprehensive collection of transcriptomic profiles across multiple species, thus serving as a fundamental resource for better understanding genetic regulatory architecture and functional mechanisms from tissues to cells.",We would like to thank Zhuojing Fan for her help on web interface design and a number of users for providing supports and reporting bugs.

In this report, we propose the concept of MHC, which refers to mild mental and physical complaints subjectively perceived by individuals that are not caused by illness. We also planned to examine what kind of physical and mental disorder MHC is and whether food is effective as a method of self-care for MHC. First, we conducted ""the comprehensive survey to establish an integrated database of food, gut microbiome, and health information"" (the ""Sukoyaka Health Survey"") and obtained data on psychosomatic disorders and intakes of dietary nutrients. As a result, through factor analysis and item response theory analysis, we found the following specific examples of MHC: lack of vigor, irritability, fatigue, and somatic complaints. In addition, analysis of the relationship between these four MHC levels and the intake dietary nutrients indicated that they are closely related and that MHC levels can be improved by consuming sufficient amounts of multiple nutrients.","This study was supported by the cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), “Technologies for Smart Bio-industry and Agriculture”.","This research was funded by the cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), “Technologies for Smart Bio-industry and Agriculture” (funding agency: Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution, NARO, Japan), grant number: SIP2B.",Nutrients,,Amanda N.

Several studies have reported that soursop (Annona muricata L.) leaves can be used to treat cervical cancer. This study aims to determine the use of endophytic fungi of A. muricata leaves extract as an ingredient that inhibits cervical cancer. The isolated endophytic fungi from various soursop leave accessions were grown in culture media, then extracted using ethyl acetate. The extract was then tested against anti-yeast, cervical cancer cells, and on normal cells as control using the MTT method. Five isolated fungi were selected based on the greatest inhibition in one concentration, and the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) value was determined. The soursop leaves endophytic fungi extracts showed cytotoxicity against cervical cancer cells by inhibiting the multiplication of HeLa cancer cells in vitro. The Sir-SM2 endophytic fungi crude ethyl acetate extract showed high cytotoxicity to cervical cancer cells (HeLa cells) but less harmful to the normal Chang cells; therefore can be a natural anticancer. Identification based on morphology shows that the isolated Sir-SM2 endophytic fungi belong to the Penicillium genus, and molecular identification based on Internal Transcribed Spacer shows high similarities with Penicillium crustosum.","This research was funded by the Agricultural Research and Development Agency, Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia, which the author would like to thank.",,Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences,,,Elsevier,"1319-562X, 2213-7106",,2022-06-21,2022,2022-06-21,2022-08,29,8,103354,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hasan, Akhmad Endang Zainal; Julistiono, Heddy; Bermawie, Nurliani; Riyanti, Eny Ida; Arifni, Fahru Reza","Hasan, Akhmad Endang Zainal (Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Bogor Agricultural University, Jl.

Such schisms have profound implications for the way in which we manage and conceptualize agrobiodiversity and its benefits. This paper explores the relationship between farmers' rights, as recognized in the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, and the dematerialization of genetic resources. Using concepts of ""stewardship"" and ""ownership"" we emphasize the need to move away from viewing agrobiodiversity as a commodity that can be owned, toward a strengthened, proactive and expansive stewardship approach that recognizes plant genetic resources for food and agriculture as a public good which should be governed as such. Through this lens we analyze the relationship between digital sequence information and different elements of farmers' rights to compare and contrast implications for the governance of digital sequence information. Two possible parallel pathways are presented, the first envisaging an enhanced multilateral system that includes digital sequence information and which promotes and enhances the realization of farmers' rights; and the second a more radical approach that folds together concepts of stewardship, farmers' rights, and open source science. Farmers' rights, we suggest, may well be the linchpin for finding fair and equitable solutions for digital sequence information beyond the bilateral and transactional approach that has come to characterize access and benefit sharing under the Convention on Biological Diversity. Existing policy uncertainties could be seized as an unexpected but serendipitous opportunity to chart an alternative and visionary pathway for the rights of farmers and other custodians of plant genetic resources.",,"Funding.

The ProteomeXchange (PX) consortium of proteomics resources (http://www.proteomexchange.org) was originally set up to standardize data submission and dissemination of public MS proteomics data. It is now 10 years since the initial data workflow was implemented. In this manuscript, we describe the main developments in PX since the previous update manuscript in Nucleic Acids Research was published in 2020. The six members of the Consortium are PRIDE, PeptideAtlas (including PASSEL), MassIVE, jPOST, iProX and Panorama Public. We report the current data submission statistics, showcasing that the number of datasets submitted to PX resources has continued to increase every year. As of June 2022, more than 34 233 datasets had been submitted to PX resources, and from those, 20 062 (58.6%) just in the last three years. We also report the development of the Universal Spectrum Identifiers and the improvements in capturing the experimental metadata annotations. In parallel, we highlight that data re-use activities of public datasets continue to increase, enabling connections between PX resources and other popular bioinformatics resources, novel research and also new data resources.

Neural cells are useful for the evaluation of risk assessment of infectious diseases since several avian species die of encephalitis derived from infectious diseases. In this study, we attempted to develop induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology for avian species by forming organoids containing neural-like cells. In our previous study, we established two types iPSCs from chicken somatic cells, the first is iPSCs with PB-R6F reprogramming vector and the second is iPSCs with PB-TAD-7F reprogramming vector. In this study, we first compared the nature of these two cell types using RNA-seq analysis. The total gene expression of iPSCs with PB-TAD-7F was closer to that of chicken ESCs than that of iPSCs with PB-R6F; therefore, we used iPSCs with PB-TAD-7F to form organoids containing neural-like cells. We successfully established organoids containing neural-like cells from iPSCs using PB-TAD-7F. Furthermore, our organoids responded to poly:IC through the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family. In this study, we developed iPSCs technology for avian species via organoid formation. In the future, organoids containing neural-like cells from avian iPSCs can develop as a new evaluation tool for infectious disease risk in avian species, including endangered avian species.",,"This work was supported by internal funds from all the authors’ institutions and JSPS KAKENHI (21H02218).

Led by an array of asynchronous digitization activities spanning ecological, environmental, climatological, and biological collections data, these initiatives have resulted in a plethora of mostly disconnected and siloed data, leaving to researchers the tedious and time-consuming manual task of finding and connecting them in usable ways, integrating them into coherent data sets, and making them interoperable. The focus to date has been on elevating analog and physical records to digital replicas in local databases prior to elevating them to ever-growing aggregations of essentially disconnected discipline-specific information. In the present article, we propose a new interconnected network of digital objects on the Internet-the Digital Extended Specimen (DES) network-that transcends existing aggregator technology, augments the DES with third-party data through machine algorithms, and provides a platform for more efficient research and robust interdisciplinary discovery.","This work has received funding from the European Union᾿s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no. 871043 (DiSSCo Prepare) and the US National Science Foundation awards no.

3383,pub.1153600488,10.1007/s13258-022-01353-7,36512198,,,Quality control of fighting fish nucleotide sequences in public repositories reveals a dark matter of systematic taxonomic implication,"BackgroundThe number of nucleotide sequences in public repositories has exploded recently. However, the data contain errors, leading to incorrect species identification. Several fighting fish (Betta spp.) are poorly described, with unresolved cryptic species complexes masking undescribed species. Here, DNA barcoding was used to detect erroneous sequences in public repositories.ObjectiveThis study reflects the current quantitative and qualitative status of DNA barcoding in fighting fish and provides a rapid and reliable identification tool.MethodsA total of 1034 barcode sequences were analyzed from mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cytb) genes from 71 fighting fish species.ResultsThe nearest neighbor test showed the highest percentage of intraspecific nearest neighbors at 93.41% for COI and 91.67% for Cytb, which can be used as reference barcodes for certain taxa. Intraspecific variation was usually less than 13%, while most species differed by more than 54%. The barcoding gap, calculated from the difference between inter- and intraspecific sequence divergences, was negative in the COI data set indicating overlapping intra- and interspecific sequence divergence.

To understand their characteristics and adaptability to various nutrient sources, we applied strain-specific, nucleotide-concatenated (SSC) sequences to the phylogenetic analysis of 32 L. sakei strains isolated from various locations and products. SSC sequences were developed by concatenating the polymorphisms detected by whole-genome sequencing. This enabled us to use sufficient polymorphisms and avoid the bias caused by selecting partial sequences, such as that in core genome and multi-locus sequence typing. SSC sequence-based analysis revealed that the phylogenetic relations for L. sakei are based on the different nutrition sources rather than geographical distance.","The present study was funded by JSPS KAKENHI grant No. 21K05346 and by a grant to TK from the Mitani Foundation for Research and Development (2020).

Universities turn out millions of graduates annually, but at the same time, employers highlight their lack of the requisite skills for sustainable employment. We live today in a world of data, and therefore courses that feature numerical and computational tools to gather and analyse data are to be sourced for and integrated into life sciences' curricula as they provide a number of benefits for both the students and faculty members that are engaged in teaching the courses. The lack of this teaching in undergraduate Microbiology curricula is devastating and leaves a knowledge gap in the graduates that are turned out. This results in an inability of the emerging graduates to compete favourably with their counterparts from other parts of the world. There is a necessity on the part of life science educators to adapt their teaching strategies to best support students' curricula that prepare them for careers in science.

Gerhardtia venosolamellata is found on broad-leaf litter, and is characterized by tricholomatoid to marasmioid basidiomata, an off-white to pale salmon-pink pileus surface with faint marginal striae, subdistant lamellae with lateral veins, a tomentose to strigose stipe base with hyphal strands generating arthroconidia measuring 4-7 × 2-3 µm, cyanophilic, elongate-ellipsoid to cylindrical, slightly verrucose or undulate basidiospores measuring 4.5-6 × 2.5-3 µm, and cyanophilic basidia measuring 25-35 × 5-6 µm and containing siderophilous granules. Phylogenetic analyses based on the internal transcribed spacer and large subunit regions of the fungal nrDNA indicates that G. venosolamellata is related to G. sinensis and G. highlandensis, but differs from the former with respect to basidiomata color, basidiospore shape, and habitat. An isotype specimen of G. highlandensis exhibited relatively close lamellae without veins, and slightly larger basidiospores (4.5-6.5 × 2.5-3 µm). Cultured mycelia of G. venosolamellata produced arthroconidia measuring 4.5-8.5 × 2.5-3 µm with both schizolytic and rhexolytic secession on MA and PDA media, and chlamydospores occasionally covered with crystals on MA and MYG media.","We great thank Dr. Patrick B.

Although the epidemiology and pathogenicity of coronaviruses have gained substantial attention, little is known about bovine coronavirus in cattle, which possesses a close relationship with human coronavirus. Bovine torovirus (BToV) is a newly identified relevant pathogen associated with cattle diarrhoea and respiratory diseases, and its epidemiology in the Chinese cattle industry remains unknown.ResultsIn this study, a total of 461 diarrhoeic faecal samples were collected from 38 different farms in three intensive cattle farming regions and analysed. Our results demonstrated that BToV is present in China, with a low prevalence rate of 1.74% (8/461). The full-length spike genes were further cloned from eight clinical samples (five farms in Henan Province). Phylogenetic analysis showed that two different subclades of BToV strains are circulating in China. Meanwhile, the three BToV strains identified from dairy calves, 18,307, 2YY and 5YY, all contained the amino acid variants R614Q, I801T, N841S and Q885E.ConclusionsThis is the first report to confirm the presence of BToV in beef and dairy calves in China with diarrhea, which extend our understanding of the epidemiology of BToVs worldwide.",We thank all the cattle farms for submitting the samples to our laboratory.

One of the consequences is that it becomes extremely difficult to store, backup, and migrate enormous amount of genomic datasets, not to mention they continue to expand as the cost of sequencing decreases. Herein, a much more efficient and scalable program to perform genome compression is required urgently. In this manuscript, we propose a new Apache Spark based Genome Compression method called SparkGC that can run efficiently and cost-effectively on a scalable computational cluster to compress large collections of genomes. SparkGC uses Spark’s in-memory computation capabilities to reduce compression time by keeping data active in memory between the first-order and second-order compression. The evaluation shows that the compression ratio of SparkGC is better than the best state-of-the-art methods, at least better by 30%. The compression speed is also at least 3.8 times that of the best state-of-the-art methods on only one worker node and scales quite well with the number of nodes. SparkGC is of significant benefit to genomic data storage and transmission. The source code of SparkGC is publicly available at https://github.com/haichangyao/SparkGC.",We thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions to improve the quality of our manuscript.,"This work was partially funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018AAA0103300), The Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (22KJB520001), Modern Educational Technology Research Program of Jiangsu Province in 2022 (2022-R-98629), Scientific Research Start-up Foundation of Nanjing Vocational University of Industry Technology (YK21-05-04), Research Project of Chinese National Light Industry Vocational Education and Teaching Steering Committee in 2021 (QGHZW2021066).",BMC Bioinformatics,,,Springer Nature,1471-2105,"Algorithms; Data Compression; Genome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software",2022-07-25,2022,2022-07-25,2022-12,23,1,297,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yao, Haichang; Hu, Guangyong; Liu, Shangdong; Fang, Houzhi; Ji, Yimu","Yao, Haichang (School of Computer and Software, Nanjing Vocational University of Industry Technology, 210023, Nanjing, China); Hu, Guangyong (School of Computer and Software, Nanjing Vocational University of Industry Technology, 210023, Nanjing, China); Liu, Shangdong (School of Computer Science, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 210023, Nanjing, China); Fang, Houzhi (School of Computer Science, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 210023, Nanjing, China); Ji, Yimu (School of Computer Science, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 210023, Nanjing, China; Jiangsu HPC and Intelligent Processing Engineer Research Center, 210003, Nanjing, China; Institute of High Performance Computing and Bigdata, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 210023, Nanjing, China)","Ji, Yimu (Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; ; Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications)","Yao, Haichang (); Hu, Guangyong (); Liu, Shangdong (Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Fang, Houzhi (Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Ji, Yimu (Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications)",Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications,grid.453246.2,Nanjing,,China,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China,,China; China,,,2,2,,,4,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12859-022-04825-5,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149721684,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; 3105 Genetics,Genetics; Human Genome,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

In this study, we aimed to detect tick-borne pathogens through investigating prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms in camel blood based on a metagenomic approach and then to characterize potentially pathogenic organisms using traditional molecular techniques. We showed that the bacteria circulating in the blood of camels is dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. At the genus level, Sediminibacterium, Hydrotalea, Bradyrhizobium and Anaplasma were the most abundant taxa. Eukaryotic profile was dominated by Fungi, Charophyta and Apicomplexa. At the genus level, Theileria was detected in 10 out of 18 samples, while Sarcocystis, Hoplorhynchus and Stylocephalus were detected in one sample each. Our metagenomic approach was successful in the detection of several pathogens or potential pathogens including Anaplasma sp., Theileria ovis, Th. separata, Th. annulate, Th. mutans-like and uncharacterized Theileria sp. For further characterization, we provided the partial sequences of citrate synthase (gltA) and heat-shock protein (groEL) genes of Candidatus Anaplasma camelii. We also detected Trypanosoma evansi type A using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region. This combined metagenomic and traditional approach will contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology of pathogens including tick-borne bacteria and protozoa in animals.",We would like to thank to all collaborators who supported the collection of camel blood in Egypt.,"This research was supported by KAKENHI (16H06431, 19H03118, 19F19097, 20K21358 and 20KK0151) and the Japan Program for Infectious Diseases Research and Infrastructure (20wm0225016j0001) from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED).",Pathogens,,Alejandro Cabezas-Cruz,MDPI,2076-0817,,2021-03-16,2021,2021-03-16,,10,3,351,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mohamed, Wessam Mohamed Ahmed; Ali, Alsagher O.; Mahmoud, Hassan Y.

In the development of the course and over three semesters, successive teams of undergraduate students collected field samples and performed enrichment and isolation techniques specific for the detection of S. enterica. Eighty-eight strains were confirmed using standard microbiological methods and PCR of the invA gene. The isolates' genomes were Illumina-sequenced by the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA and the Virginia state Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services as part of the GenomeTrakr program. Students used GalaxyTrakr and other web- and non-web-based platforms and tools to perform quality control on raw and assembled sequence data, assemble, and annotate genomes, identify antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, putative plasmids, and other mobile genetic elements. Strains with putative plasmid-borne antimicrobial resistance genes were further sequenced by students in our research lab using the Oxford Nanopore MinIONTM platform. Strains of Salmonella that were isolated include human infectious serotypes such as Typhimurium and Infantis. Over 31 of the isolates possessed antibiotic resistance genes, some of which were located on large, multidrug resistance plasmids. Plasmid pHJ-38, identified in a Typhimurium isolate, is an apparently self-transmissible 183 kb IncA/C2 plasmid that possesses multiple antimicrobial resistance and heavy-metal resistance genes. Plasmid pFHS-02, identified in an Infantis isolate, is an apparently self-transmissible 303 kb IncF1B plasmid that also possesses numerous heavy-metal and antimicrobial resistance genes. Using direct and indirect measures to assess student outcomes, results indicate that course participation contributed to cognitive gains in relevant content knowledge and research skills such as field sampling, molecular techniques, and computational analysis. Furthermore, participants self-reported a deeper interest in scientific research and careers as well as psychosocial outcomes (e.g., sense of belonging and self-efficacy) commonly associated with student success and persistence in STEM. Overall, this course provided a powerful combination of field, wet lab, and computational biology experiences for students, while also providing data potentially useful in pathogen surveillance, epidemiological tracking, and for the further study of environmental reservoirs of S. enterica.",The authors gratefully acknowledge Dr. Lauren Turner and the Virginia Department of Consolidated Laboratory Services and Drs.

The present in silico investigation was performed to reveal the biophysical characteristics and immunogenic epitopes of the 14 blood-stage proteins of the P. falciparum using comprehensive immunoinformatics approaches. For this aim, various web servers were employed to predict subcellular localization, antigenicity, allergenicity, solubility, physicochemical properties, posttranslational modification sites (PTMs), the presence of signal peptide, and transmembrane domains. Moreover, structural analysis for secondary and 3D model predictions were performed for all and stable proteins, respectively. Finally, human helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes were predicted using HLA reference set of IEDB server and screened in terms of antigenicity, allergenicity, and IFN-γ induction as well as population coverage. Also, a multiserver B-cell epitope prediction was done with subsequent screening for antigenicity, allergenicity, and solubility. Altogether, these proteins showed appropriate antigenicity, abundant PTMs, and many B-cell and HTL epitopes, which could be directed for future vaccination studies in the context of multiepitope vaccine design.",,,BioMed Research International,,Amogh A.

They function as a mode of intercellular communication and molecular transfer. Exosome cargo molecules, including small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), are involved in the immune response in various organisms. However, the role of exosome-derived sncRNAs in immune responses in molluscs remains unclear. Here, we aimed to reveal the sncRNAs involved in the immune response during grafting transplantation by the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata. Exosomes were successfully extracted from the P. fucata haemolymph during graft transplantation. Abundant microRNAs (miRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were simultaneously discovered in P. fucata exosomes by small RNA sequencing. The expression patterns of the miRNAs and piRNAs at the grafting and initial stages were not substantially different, but varied significantly between the initial and later stages. Target prediction and functional analysis indicate that these miRNAs and piRNAs are related to immune response upon grafting transplantation, whereas piRNAs may also be associated with transposon silencing by targeting with genome transposon elements. This work provides the basis for a functional understanding of exosome-derived sncRNAs and helps to gain further insight into the PIWI/piRNA pathway function outside of germline cells in molluscs.",,This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (grant no.

However, the features of cells in the central nervous system that undergo senescence and their role in neural impairment are not well understood as yet. Here, through comprehensive investigations utilising single-cell transcriptome analysis and various mouse models, we show that microglia, particularly in the white matter, undergo cellular senescence in the brain and spinal cord during ageing and in disease models involving demyelination. Microglial senescence is predominantly detected in disease-associated microglia, which appear in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases. We also find that commensal bacteria promote the accumulation of senescent microglia and disease-associated microglia during ageing. Furthermore, knockout of p16INK4a, a key senescence inducer, ameliorates the neuroinflammatory phenotype in damaged spinal cords in mice. These results advance our understanding of the role of cellular senescence in the central nervous system and open up possibilities for the treatment of age-related neural disorders.","We acknowledge the NGS core facility of the Genome Information Research Center at the RIMD (Osaka University) for the support in RNA sequencing and data analysis.

Comprehensive gene expression analysis in Alternaria-exposed mouse airways, a model of SAFS, has not been conducted.
METHODS: BALB/c mice received intranasal administration of Alternaria extract or phosphate-buffered saline twice a week for 6 weeks. Lung sections and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were obtained to assess airway inflammation. RNA-Seq in the central airway was performed, and gene ontology (GO) analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were conducted for pathway analyses. An in vitro experiment using human airway epithelial cell 16HBE14o- was performed to validate the RNA-Seq findings.
RESULTS: Eosinophilic airway inflammation with mucus overproduction and airway remodeling was observed in mice exposed to Alternaria. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 403 upregulated and 108 downregulated genes in airways of Alternaria-exposed mice. In GO analysis, the functions of immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor binding, Ig production, inflammatory response, and T-cell activation were upregulated, while those of keratinization and defense response to other organisms were downregulated. GSEA revealed positive enrichment in T-cell receptor complex, immunological synapse, antigen binding, mast cell activation, and Ig receptor binding, and negative enrichment in keratinization and cornification in Alternaria-exposed mice relative to control. Alternaria exposure to 16HBE14o- cells validated the downregulation of epithelial keratinization-related genes, including SPRR1A, SPRR1B, and KRT6B.

This disease is rapidly spreading among the human population but unfortunately, there is no specific medication to treat it except the efforts geared toward repurposing of the existing drugs of influenza, HIV and hepatitis. Several research groups from various countries released genome and amino acid sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 using different bioinformatics tools and software. The field of bioinformatics utilizes the in silico tools that are useful in analyzing the new genes, whole genome, or proteomes. It plays a major role in sequence analysis and annotations in finding therapeutic drug targets.

An indigenous berry of Thailand, Cleistocalyx nervosum var. paniala (CNP), has been recognized for its robust antioxidants. We investigated the effects and mechanisms of CNP fruit extracts on antioxidant-related survival pathways against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. The extract showed strong antioxidant capability and had high total phenolic and flavonoid contents, particularly resveratrol. Next, the protective effects of the CNP extract or resveratrol on the glutamate-induced neurotoxicity were examined in HT22 hippocampal cells. Our investigation showed that the pretreatment of cells with the CNP extract or resveratrol attenuated glutamate-induced neuronal death via suppression of apoptosis cascade by inhibiting the levels of cleaved- and pro-caspase-3 proteins. The CNP extract and resveratrol suppressed the intracellular ROS by increasing the mRNA expression level of antioxidant enzymes (SODs, GPx1, and CAT). We found that this extract and resveratrol significantly increased SIRT1 expression as a survival-related protein. Moreover, they also promoted the activity of the Nrf2 protein translocation into the nucleus and could bind to the promoter containing the antioxidant response element, inducing the expression of the downstream GPx1-antioxidant protein. Our data illustrate that the CNP extract and resveratrol inhibit apoptotic neuronal death via glutamate-induced oxidative neurotoxicity in HT22 cells through the activation of the SIRT1/Nrf2 survival mechanism.","The authors are also thankful and appreciative of the Plant Genetic Conservation Project under the Royal Initiation of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn (RSPG).

To archive and integrate worldwide SARS-CoV-2 genome data, a series of resources have been constructed, serving as a fundamental infrastructure for SARS-CoV-2 research, pandemic prevention and control, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapy. Here we present an overview of extant SARS-CoV-2 resources that are devoted to genome data deposition and integration. We review deposition resources in data accessibility, metadata standardization, data curation and annotation; review integrative resources in data source, de-redundancy processing, data curation and quality assessment, and variant annotation. Moreover, we address issues that impede SARS-CoV-2 genome data integration, including low-complexity, inconsistency and absence of isolate name, sequence inconsistency, asynchronous update of genome data, and mismatched metadata. We finally provide insights into data standardization consensus and data submission guidelines, to promote SARS-CoV-2 genome data sharing and integration.","Acknowledgements This work was supported by Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB38030201, XDB38030400, XDB38050300]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [2019104].

This outbreak was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The spread of this disease has had a wide social and economic impact. There is still a lot of controversy surrounding this disease, including in the aspects of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Therefore, a study was carried out on studies related to COVID-19 that have been widely published since the beginning of 2020 until the end of March 2020.So to overcome this problem, the Smith Waterman Jukes Cantor Algorithm was made to align Covid19 by taking the a pair of DNA and RNA sequencesto align protein sequences. From this alignment, the percentage of identical and mutations will be known. The identical percentage in the genetic code will prove that although the symptoms caused by the disease are almost the same, the protein sequences are not necessarily the same. Based on the simulation results of the distance between sequences that produce a phylogenetic tree using the jukes cantor method, it was obtained that 4 groups of 26 sequences were divided into groups, namely, group 1 consists of 16 sequences, group 2 consists of 6 sequences, group 3 consists of 2 sequences, group 4 consists of 2 sequences. Based on these groups, it turns out that the China Wuhan sequence (sequence MT291826) is located in group 1 and other countries that are almost similar to the sequence in China Wuhan, namely the country of Timoe Leste with the sequence MT641766 also located in group 1. ©2022 JNSMR UIN Walisongo.

Cattle persistently infected (PI) with BVDV are mild or asymptomatic; however, they become a source of BVDV transmission to other cattle. Hence, it is important to rapidly identify and remove the PI animals from cattle herds. Whereas cattle acutely infected (AI) with BVDV have various symptoms, yet they generally recover within 3 weeks. However, there is a paucity of information concerning clinical characteristics of AI cattle. Further accumulation of information would be required to accurately diagnose AI cattle with BVDV. Here, we attempted to obtain valuable information via various analyses using a case report of BVD outbreak that occurred for approximately four months in Iwate Prefecture in 2017. Using eight calves and multiple tests (real-time RT-PCR, virus isolation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and virus neutralization assay) over 6 weeks, we diagnosed the continuous BVD outbreak as an acute infection and not a persistent one. Additionally, we revealed that the sporadic case was caused by low pathogenic BVDV2 via BVDV genotyping and phylogenetic analysis.

The present study aimed to identify and assess the prevalence of bacterial pathogens and their resistance potential in the fecal ecology of NCD diseased animals of Pakistan. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes (blaTEM, blaNDM-1, blaCTX-M, qnrS) was also investigated. A total of 51 bacterial isolates were recovered from feces of young diarrheic animals (n = 11), collected from 7 cities of Pakistan and identified on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence and phylogenetic analysis. Selected isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility by disc diffusion method while polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to characterize the blaTEM, blaNDM-1, blaCTX-M, qnrS and mcr-1 antibiotic resistance genes. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences (Accession numbers: LC488898 to LC488948), all isolates were identified that belonged to seventeen genera with the highest prevalence rate for phylum Proteobacteria and genus Bacillus (23%). Antibiotic susceptibility explained the prevalence of resistance in isolates ciprofloxacin (100%), ampicillin (100%), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (85%), tetracycline (75%), amoxicillin (55%), ofloxacin (50%), ceftazidime (45%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (45%), levofloxacin (30%), cefpodoxime (25%), cefotaxime (25%), cefotaxime/clavulanic acid (20%), and imipenem (10%). MICs demonstrated that almost 90% isolates were multi-drug resistant (against at least three antibiotics), specially against ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline with the highest resistance levels for Shigella sp. (NCCP-421) (MIC-CIP up to 75 μg mL-1) and Escherichia sp. (NCCP-432) (MIC-TET up to 250 μg mL-1). PCR-assisted detection of antibiotic resistance genes showed that 54% isolates were positive for blaTEM gene, 7% isolates were positive for blaCTX-M gene, 23% isolates were positive for each of qnrS and mcr-1 genes, 23% isolates were co-positive in combinations of qnrS and mcr-1 genes and blaTEM and mcr-1 genes, whereas none of the isolate showed presence of blaNDM-1 gene.","This work was supported partly by available resources and by Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan under the project “Ensuring Food Security and safety: Development of an integrated approach for safe usage of antibiotics” (Grant # 20-4155/RD/HEC/14).

Although several vaccines have been developed, it is still difficult to prevent and reduce the inflammation caused by the infection. Studies have shown that there are correlations between the gut environment and severity of symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several gut metabolites produced by the gut microbiota such as SCFAs and the secondary bile acid UDCA are reported to improve the survival rate of the host after viral infection in an animal model through modulation of the host immune system. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to use the prebiotic dietary fiber PHGG to modulate the gut microbiome and intestinal metabolites for improvement of host survival rate after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a Syrian hamster model. We were able to show that PHGG significantly improved the host survival rate and body weight reduction. Analysis of the gut microbiome, serum, and intestinal metabolites revealed that PHGG significantly increased the concentrations of several intestinal SCFAs, fecal secondary bile acids, and serum secondary bile acids. Furthermore, several microbial species and metabolites identified in this study are consistent with reports in humans. Taken together, our data suggest that PHGG is a candidate prebiotic food for reducing the morbidity of COVID-19.","We thank Yoshihiro Kawaoka (University of Wisconsin and University of Tokyo) for providing SARS-CoV-2/UT-NCGM02/Human/2020/Tokyo.

Although cigarette smoke is generally believed to be harmful to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treatments were surprisingly found to suppress the expression of ACE2 in HepG2 cells. We thus tried to clarify the mechanism of CSE effects on expression of ACE2 in mammalian cells. Because RNA-seq analysis suggested that suppressive effects on ACE2 might be inversely correlated with induction of the genes regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the AHR agonists 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) and omeprazole (OMP) were tested to assess whether those treatments affected ACE2 expression. Both FICZ and OMP clearly suppressed ACE2 expression in a dose-dependent manner along with inducing CYP1A1 . Knock-down experiments indicated a reduction of ACE2 by FICZ treatment in an AHR-dependent manner. Finally, treatments of AHR agonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection into Vero E6 cells as determined with immunoblotting analyses detecting SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleocapsid protein. We here demonstrate that treatment with AHR agonists, including CSE, FICZ, and OMP, decreases expression of ACE2 via AHR activation, resulting in suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mammalian cells.",We greatly appreciate the technical support provided by Ms. Chiyo Oda.

COVID-19, a disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is of the Orthocoronavirinae sub-family, which shares genome sequence similarity with two other highly pathogenic members of the group, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). All three members are thought to have emerged from zoonotic events that have triggered global outbreaks over the last two decades. There is currently no cure, vaccine, or standard treatment protocol for COVID-19. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has had serious consequences with such an alarming rate of morbidity and mortality. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) could help quickly repurpose drugs that have been approved by the FDA and also to identify new antiviral compounds.

Periodic cross-sectional studies during the surge of COVID-19 cases is essential to elucidate the pandemic situation.   Methods Sera of 1,000 individuals who underwent a health check-up in Hyogo Prefecture Health Promotion Association clinics in Japan were collected in August and December 2021. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 N and S antigens were detected in the sera by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The sera’s neutralization activities for the conventional SARS-CoV-2 (D614G), Delta, and Omicron variants were measured.   Results The seropositive rates for the antibody against N antigen were 2.1% and 3.9% in August and December 2021 respectively, demonstrating a Delta variant endemic during that time; the actual infection rate was approximately twofold higher than the rate estimated based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnosis. The anti-S seropositive rate was 38.7% in August and it reached 90.8% in December, in concordance with the vaccination rate in Japan. In the December cohort, 78.7% of the sera showed neutralizing activity against the Delta variant, whereas that against the Omicron was much lower at 36.6%.   Conclusions These analyses revealed that herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 including the Delta variant was established in December 2021, leading to convergence of the variants. The low neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant suggests the need for the further promotion of the prompt three-dose vaccination to overcome this variant’s imminent 6th wave in Japan.   Summary Seroepidemiologic study of COVID-19 on December 2021 in Japan showed neutralizing antibodies for Delta were 78.7%, indicating the acquisition of herd immunity by mass vaccination leading to convergence while those for Omicron were only 36.6%, indicating need of booster vaccination.","We thank Kazuro Sugimura MD, PhD (Superintendent, Hyogo Prefectural Hospital Agency and Professor, Kobe University) for his full support of this study.

Horn fly control relies on insecticides; however, alternative control methods such as vaccines are needed due to the fly's capacity to quickly develop resistance to insecticides, and the pressure for eco-friendly options.MethodsWe used a reverse vaccinology approach comprising three vaccine prediction and 11 annotation tools to evaluate and rank 79,542 translated open reading frames (ORFs) from the horn fly's transcriptome, and selected 10 transcript ORFs as vaccine candidates for expression in Pichia pastoris. The expression of the 10 selected transcripts and the proteins that they encoded were investigated in adult flies by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and mass spectrometry, respectively. Then, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate in an immunization trial and the antigen’s effects on horn fly mortality and fecundity in an in vitro feeding assay.ResultsSix of the ten vaccine candidate antigens were successfully expressed in P. pastoris. RT-PCR confirmed the expression of all six ORFs in adult fly RNA. One of the vaccine candidate antigens, BI-HS009, was expressed in sufficient quantity for immunogenicity and efficacy trials. The IgG titers of animals vaccinated with BI-HS009 plus adjuvant were significantly higher than those of animals vaccinated with buffer plus adjuvant only from days 42 to 112, with a peak on day 56. Progeny of horn flies feeding upon blood from animals vaccinated with BI-HS009 plus adjuvant collected on day 56 had 63% lower pupariation rate and 57% lower adult emergence than the control group (ANOVA: F(1, 6) = 8.221, P = 0.028 and F(1, 6) = 8.299, P = 0.028, respectively).ConclusionsThe reverse vaccinology approach streamlined the discovery process by prioritizing possible vaccine antigen candidates. Through a thoughtful process of selection and in vivo and in vitro evaluations, we were able to identify a promising antigen for an anti-horn fly vaccine.Graphical abstract","We wish to acknowledge the assistance of Matthew Waldon (KBUSLIRL) with the in vitro feeding assays; Dr. Chau-Wen Chou (Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia) for performing the mass spectrometry analyses; Deanna Bodine (KBUSLIRL) for assistance with RNA extractions and cDNA synthesis; Lindsay Harrison and Frederic Dumas (Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, Athens) for vaccine preparation for the immunization trials; JC Audonnet (Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, Lyon) and Justin Widener (Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, Athens) for helping interpret the data during all phases of the study.

Lymphopenia is a common feature in severe cases of COVID-19; however, the role of T cell responses during infection is unclear. Here, we inoculated six cynomolgus monkeys, divided into two groups according to the CD3+ T cell population in peripheral blood, with two clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2: one of East Asian lineage and one of European lineage. After initial infection with the isolate of East Asian lineage, all three monkeys in the CD3+ low group showed clinical symptoms, including loss of appetite, lethargy, and transient severe anemia with/without short-term fever, within 14 days post-infection (p.i.). By contrast, all three monkeys in the CD3+ high group showed mild clinical symptoms such as mild fever and loss of appetite within 4 days p.i. and then recovered. After a second inoculation with the isolate of European lineage, three of four animals in both groups showed mild clinical symptoms but recovered quickly. Hematological, immunological, and serological tests suggested that the CD3+ high and low groups mounted different immune responses during the initial and second infection stages. In both groups, anti-viral and innate immune responses were activated during the early phase of infection and re-infection. However, in the CD3+ low group, inflammatory responses, such as increased production of monocytes and neutrophils, were stronger than those in the CD3+ high group, leading to more severe immunopathology and failure to eliminate the virus. Taken together, the data suggest that the peripheral T lymphocyte population is associated with pneumonia severity in cynomolgus monkeys experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2.  Author summary SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an illness with clinical manifestations that vary from asymptomatic or mild to severe; examples include severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Lymphopenia, which is common in severe COVID-19 cases, is characterized by markedly reduced numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. Here, we showed that cynomolgus monkeys selected according to the T cell populations in peripheral blood have different outcomes after experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings will increase our understanding of disease pathogenesis and may facilitate the development of animal models for vaccine evaluation.","We thank Dr Shutoku Matsuyama and Dr Makoto Takeda (National Institute of Infectious Disease) for providing VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells and SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

During the past two decades, many herpesviruses have been identified in various bats worldwide by genetic approaches, whereas there have been few reports on the isolation of infectious herpesviruses. Herein, we report the prevalence of herpesvirus infection of bats captured in Zambia and genetic characterization of novel gammaherpesviruses isolated from striped leaf-nosed bats (Macronycteris vittatus). By our PCR screening, herpesvirus DNA polymerase (DPOL) genes were detected in 29.2% (7/24) of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), 78.1% (82/105) of Macronycteris vittatus, and one Sundevall's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros caffer) in Zambia. Phylogenetic analyses of the detected partial DPOL genes revealed that the Zambian bat herpesviruses were divided into seven betaherpesvirus groups and five gammaherpesvirus groups. Two infectious strains of a novel gammaherpesvirus, tentatively named Macronycteris gammaherpesvirus 1 (MaGHV1), were successfully isolated from Macronycteris vittatus bats, and their complete genomes were sequenced. The genome of MaGHV1 encoded 79 open reading frames, and phylogenic analyses of the DNA polymerase and glycoprotein B demonstrated that MaGHV1 formed an independent lineage sharing a common origin with other bat-derived gammaherpesviruses. Our findings provide new information regarding the genetic diversity of herpesviruses maintained in African bats.","We would like to thank Aiko Ohnuma and Naoko Kawai from the International Institute for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, and Sakiko Ueda from the Women’s Future Development Organization, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, for technical support of analyses.

Although PRVs have been identified in fruit bats and humans in Australia and Asia, little is known about the prevalence of PRV infection in Africa. Therefore, this study performed an PRV surveillance in fruit bats in Zambia.
METHODS: Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus, n = 47) and straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum, n = 33) captured in Zambia in 2017-2018 were screened for PRV infection using RT-PCR and serum neutralization tests. The complete genome sequence of an isolated PRV strain was determined by next generation sequencing and subjected to BLAST and phylogenetic analyses. Replication capacity and pathogenicity of the strain were investigated using Vero E6 cell cultures and BALB/c mice, respectively.
RESULTS: An PRV strain, tentatively named Nachunsulwe-57, was isolated from one Egyptian fruit bat. Serological assays demonstrated that 98% of sera (69/70) collected from Egyptian fruit bats (n = 37) and straw-colored fruit bats (n = 33) had neutralizing antibodies against PRV. Genetic analyses revealed that all 10 genome segments of Nachunsulwe-57 were closely related to a bat-derived Kasama strain found in Uganda. Nachunsulwe-57 showed less efficiency in viral growth and lower pathogenicity in mice than another PRV strain, Miyazaki-Bali/2007, isolated from a patient.
CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of Egyptian fruit bats and straw-colored fruit bats were found to be seropositive to PRV in Zambia. Importantly, a new PRV strain (Nachunsulwe-57) was isolated from an Egyptian fruit bat in Zambia, which had relatively weak pathogenicity in mice. Taken together, our findings provide new epidemiological insights about PRV infection in bats and indicate the first isolation of an PRV strain that may have low pathogenicity to humans.","This work was supported by grants for the Japan Initiative for Global Research Network of Infectious Diseases (JP15fm0108008) (HS) and the Japan Program for Infectious Diseases Research and Infrastructure (JP20wm0125008) (HS) from Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED); and grants for the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) within the framework of the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) (JP19jm0110019) (AT).

2267,pub.1150639651,10.1101/2022.08.30.505966,,,,Impact of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants in previously infected hamsters,"ABSTRACT  The diversity of SARS-CoV-2 mutations raises the possibility of reinfection of individuals previously infected with earlier variants, and this risk is further increased by the emergence of the B.1.1.529 Omicron variant. In this study, we used an in vivo , hamster infection model to assess the potential for individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 to be reinfected with Omicron variant and we also investigated the pathology associated with such infections. Initially, Syrian hamsters were inoculated with a lineage A, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617.2 or a subvariant of Omicron, BA.1 strain and then reinfected with the BA.1 strain 5 weeks later. Subsequently, the impact of reinfection with Omicron subvariants (BA.1 and BA.2) in individuals previously infected with the BA.1 strain was examined. Although viral infection and replication were suppressed in both the upper and lower airways, following reinfection, virus-associated RNA was detected in the airways of most hamsters. Viral replication was more strongly suppressed in the lower respiratory tract than in the upper respiratory tract. Consistent amino acid substitutions were observed in the upper respiratory tract of infected hamsters after primary infection with variant BA.1, whereas diverse mutations appeared in hamsters reinfected with the same variant. Histopathology showed no acute pneumonia or disease enhancement in any of the reinfection groups and, in addition, the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the airways of reinfected animals was only mildly elevated. These findings are important for understanding the risk of reinfection with new variants of SARS-CoV-2.   IMPORTANCE The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the widespread use of COVID-19 vaccines has resulted in individual differences in immune status against SARS-CoV-2. A decay in immunity over time and the emergence of variants that partially evade the immune response can also lead to reinfection. In this study, we demonstrated that, in hamsters, immunity acquired following primary infection with previous SARS-CoV-2 variants was effective in preventing the onset of pneumonia after reinfection with the Omicron variant. However, viral infection and multiplication in the upper respiratory tract were still observed after reinfection. We also showed that more diverse nonsynonymous mutations appeared in the upper respiratory tract of reinfected hamsters that had acquired immunity from primary infection. This hamster model reveals the within-host evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and its pathology after reinfection, and provides important information for countermeasures against diversifying SARS-CoV-2 variants.","We thank Dr Shutoku Matsuyama and Dr Makoto Takeda (National Institute of Infectious Disease) for providing SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

During 2018-2019, Legionnaires' disease occurred in 5 persons after they visited the park; 3 of these persons were potentially exposed in spa facilities that used untreated hot spring water. Environmental testing revealed Legionella bacteria in piped spring water, including 134°F stagnant pipe water. These findings underscore the importance of water management programs to reduce Legionella growth in plumbing through control activities such as maintaining hot water temperatures, reducing stored water age, and ensuring adequate water flow.","We thank Hot Springs National Park staff; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Respiratory Diseases Branch staff; the city of Hot Springs, Arkansas; the Arkansas Department of Health; the National Park Service Office of Public Health; bathhouse A staff; and facility X staff.",,Emerging Infectious Diseases,,,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),"1080-6040, 1080-6059","Arkansas; Hot Springs; Humans; Legionella pneumophila; Legionnaires' Disease; Parks, Recreational; United States; Water; Water Microbiology; Water Supply",2022-01,2022,,2022-01,28,1,44-50,All OA; Gold,Article,"James, Allison E.; Kesteloot, Kurt; Paul, J.

An effective vaccine is needed, but data on protective immune responses in human melioidosis are lacking. We used ELISA and an antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis assay to identify the major features of protective antibodies in patients with acute melioidosis in Thailand. We found that high levels of B. pseudomallei-specific IgG2 are associated with protection against death in a multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, diabetes, renal disease, and neutrophil count. Serum from melioidosis survivors enhanced bacteria uptake into human monocytes expressing FcγRIIa-H/R131, an intermediate-affinity IgG2-receptor, compared with serum from nonsurvivors. We did not find this enhancement when using monocytes carrying the low IgG2-affinity FcγRIIa-R131 allele. The findings indicate the importance of IgG2 in protection against death in human melioidosis, a crucial finding for antibody-based therapeutics and vaccine development.","We are grateful for the help and support from all participants and staff at Sunpasitthiprasong Hospital and the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU), which receives core support from the Wellcome Trust.

Epizootics in New World nonhuman primates are sentinel events for YF virus circulation. However, genus-specific susceptibilities and suitability for YF surveillance remain poorly understood. We obtained and compared epidemiologic, histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular results from 93 human and 1,752 primate cases submitted during the recent YF outbreak in Brazil (2017), with the support of the Brazilian National YF Surveillance Program. We detected heterogeneous YF-associated profiles among the various genera of primates we analyzed. Alouatta primates were the most reliable sentinel; Sapajus and Callicebus primates had higher viral loads but lower proportional mortality rates. Callithrix primates were the least sensitive, showing lower viral loads, lower proportional mortality rates, and no demonstrable YF virus antigen or extensive lesions in liver, despite detectable viral RNA. These differences in susceptibility, viral load, and mortality rates should be considered in strategic surveillance of epizootics and control measures for YF.","We thank all professionals directly or indirectly involved in YF surveillance in São Paulo state; field and surveillance agents and laboratorial staff, especially those from the Centro de Vigilância Epidemiológica Prof. Alexandre Vranjac and the Pathology and Virology Center, Instituto Adolfo Lutz; Andreia Latorre for critically reviewing the manuscript, and Chris Gardiner for reviewing the English version of the manuscript.

Severe cases exhibit abnormal coagulation, endothelial barrier disruption, and dysfunctional platelet aggregation but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In Sierra Leone during 2015-2018, we assessed LF patients' day-of-admission plasma samples for levels of proteins necessary for coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet function. P-selectin, soluble endothelial protein C receptor, soluble thrombomodulin, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, ADAMTS-13, von Willebrand factor, tissue factor, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 were more elevated in LF patients than in controls. Endothelial protein C receptor, thrombomodulin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, D-dimer, and hepatocyte growth factor were higher in fatal than nonfatal LF cases. Platelet disaggregation occurred only in samples from fatal LF cases. The impaired homeostasis and platelet dysfunction implicate alterations in the protein C pathway, which might contribute to the loss of endothelial barrier function in fatal infections.","We thank Zaverio Ruggeri and Roberto Aiolfi for sharing their expertise in platelet biology; John Griffin and Laurent Mosnier for discussions on the protein C pathway; and Michael Oldstone for his help in proofing this manuscript.

Understanding trends among ST131 clades will help with designing prevention strategies. We screened E. coli from blood samples (n = 1,784) obtained in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, during 2006, 2012, and 2016 by PCR for ST131 and positive samples (n = 344) underwent whole-genome sequencing. The incidence rate per 100,000 residents increased from 4.91 during 2006 to 12.35 during 2012 and 10.12 during 2016. ST131 belonged to clades A (10%), B (9%), and C (81%). Clades C1-nonM27 and B were common during 2006, and C2 containing blaCTX-M-15, C1-M27 containing blaCTX-M-27, and A were responsible for the increase of ST131 during 2012 and 2016. C2 was the most antimicrobial drug-resistant subclade and increased exponentially over time.

We conducted a 3-year prospective study on a cohort of 52 patients from this outbreak, collected clinical and multimodal imaging findings, and determined risk factors for ocular involvement. At baseline examination, 12 (23%) patients had retinochoroiditis; 4 patients had bilateral and 2 had macular lesions. Multimodal imaging revealed 2 distinct retinochoroiditis patterns: necrotizing focal retinochoroiditis and punctate retinochoroiditis. Older age, worse visual acuity, self-reported recent reduction of visual acuity, and presence of floaters were associated with retinochoroiditis. Among patients, persons >40 years of age had 5 times the risk for ocular involvement. Five patients had recurrences during follow-up, a rate of 22% per person-year. Recurrences were associated with binocular involvement. Two patients had late ocular involvement that occurred >34 months after initial diagnosis.

To achieve eradication, finding and treating asymptomatic infections as well as clinical cases is crucial. The proposed plan, the Morges strategy, involves rounds of total community treatment (i.e., treating the whole population) and total targeted treatment (TTT) (i.e., treating clinical cases and contacts). However, modeling and empirical work suggests asymptomatic infections often are not found in the same households as clinical cases, reducing the utility of household-based contact tracing for a TTT strategy. We use a model fitted to data from the Solomon Islands to predict the likelihood of elimination of transmission under different intervention schemes and levels of systematic nontreatment resulting from the intervention. Our results indicate that implementing additional treatment rounds through total community treatment is more effective than conducting additional rounds of treatment of at-risk persons through TTT.","We made use of computing resources provided by the University of Warwick’s Scientific Computing Research Technology Platform.

We assessed trends in timeliness of detecting and responding to outbreaks in the African Region reported to the World Health Organization during 2017-2019. We computed the median time to each outbreak milestone and assessed the rates of change over time using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. We selected 296 outbreaks from 348 public reported health events and evaluated 184 for time to detection, 232 for time to notification, and 201 for time to end. Time to detection and end decreased over time, whereas time to notification increased. Multiple factors can account for these findings, including scaling up support to member states after the World Health Organization established its Health Emergencies Programme and support given to countries from donors and partners to strengthen their core capacities for meeting International Health Regulations.","We are grateful to member states, WHO Country Offices, and the Health Emergencies Information and Risk Assessment teams who collected the data and shared high-quality reports that facilitated this analysis.

Participants completed an interviewer-administered health and work questionnaire. Among 203 participants (110 case-patients with positive and 93 controls with negative serologic results), approximately half were women, and more than three quarters were born in Mexico. Associated with coccidioidomycosis were self-reported dust exposure and work with root and bulb vegetable crops. A protective factor was leaf removal, an activity associated with grape cultivation. We conclude that subjective dust exposure and work with root and bulb vegetable crops are associated with increased risk for coccidioidomycosis among Hispanic farm workers.

Using random forest analysis, we studied predictions of vaccination intentions by knowledge and beliefs. Survey response rate was 52.8% among teenagers and 59.4% among parents. MenACWY vaccination intentions were best predicted by knowledge and beliefs about vaccinations in general, surpassing knowledge and beliefs about meningococcal disease and the MenACWY vaccination. For teenagers, their parents' intention that the teenager be vaccinated was a strong predictor of the teenagers' own vaccination intention.

To identify risk factors for NTM lymphadenitis, particularly complicated disease, we collected epidemiologic, clinical, and microbiological data on 138 cases of NTM lymphadenitis in children across 13 centers in Germany and Austria. We assessed lifestyle factors but did not identify specific risk behaviors. We noted that more cases of NTM lymphadenitis occurred during cold months than during warm months. Moreover, we noted female sex and age <5.5 years as potential risk factors. Complete extirpation of the affected lymph node appeared to be the best therapeutic measure. We integrated the study data to develop a simple risk score to predict unfavorable clinical outcomes for NTM lymphadenitis.","We thank Christina Kronthaler for her excellent technical support and Natalie Diffloth for her English editing help.

Although much is known about the evolution and pathogenicity of the O1/O139 serogroups of V. cholerae, information is lacking on the molecular epidemiology of non‒O1/O139 strains isolated from patients who have diarrheal illnesses. We performed whole-genome sequence analysis and in vivo infections to investigate characteristics of V. cholerae O141 isolated from sporadic diarrheal cases in 4 countries. The strains formed a distinct phylogenetic clade distinguishable from other serogroups and a unique multilocus sequence type 42, but interstrain variation suggests that O141 isolates are not clonal. These isolates encode virulence factors including cholera toxin and the toxin-coregulated pilus, as well as a type 3 secretion system. They had widely variable capacities for intestinal colonization in the infant mouse model. We propose that O141 isolates comprise a distinct clade of V. cholerae non‒O1/O139, and their continued surveillance is warranted.",This study was supported by the University of Copenhagen.

During virus characterization studies at the institute, 4 laboratory-associated infections resulted in mild to severe disease. Although orthonairoviruses are typically associated with vertebrate and tick hosts, a tick vector of KASV never has been reported. We tested 786 Ornithodoros (Reticulinasus) faini tick pools (3,930 ticks) for KASV. The ticks were collected from a large R. aegyptiacus bat roosting site in western Uganda. We detected KASV RNA in 43 tick pools and recovered 2 infectious isolates, 1 of which was derived from host blood-depleted ticks. Our findings suggest that KASV is maintained in an enzootic transmission cycle involving O. (R.) faini ticks and R. aegyptiacus bats and has the potential for incidental virus spillover to humans.","We thank Margret Driciru and the Uganda Wildlife Authority rangers at Python Cave in Queen Elizabeth National Park for providing support during the tick collections and Shannon Whitmer for providing Illumina sequencing advice.

We conducted next-generation sequencing of HCV and analyzed it for phylogenetic linkage by using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Global Hepatitis Outbreak Surveillance Technology platform. Analysis showed that 126 persons were linked across 42 clusters. Phylogenetic clustering was higher in rural communities and associated with female sex and younger age among rural residents.

To determine whether rates for specific populations such as First Nations are also increasing, we investigated iGAS cases among First Nations persons in Alberta during 2003-2017. We identified cases by isolating GAS from a sterile site and performing emm typing. We collected demographic, social, behavioral, and clinical data for patients. During the study period, 669 cases of iGAS in First Nations persons were reported. Incidence increased from 10.0 cases/100,000 persons in 2003 to 52.2 cases/100,000 persons in 2017. The 2017 rate was 6 times higher for the First Nations population than for non-First Nations populations (8.7 cases/100,000 persons). The 5 most common emm types from First Nations patients were 59, 101, 82, 41, and 11.

Two recipients of plasma from 2 lots (A and B) of pooled solvent/detergent-treated plasma were found to be infected by hepatitis E virus (HEV) that was determined to have been transmitted by the solvent/detergent-treated plasma. HEV RNA viral loads were 433 IU in lot A and 55 IU in lot B. Retrospective studies found that 100% (13/13) of evaluable lot A recipients versus 18% (3/17) of evaluable lot B recipients had been infected by HEV (p<0.001), albeit not necessarily at time of transfusion. Among evaluable recipients, 86% with a transfused HEV RNA load >50,000 IU were infected, most likely by the HEV-containing solvent/detergent-treated plasma, versus only 7% with a transfused HEV RNA load <50,000 IU (p<0.001). Overall, solvent/detergent-treated plasma might harbor HEV.

A total of 186,101 suspected cases and 440 dengue-related deaths occurred. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of this epidemic by comparing national surveillance data for 2017 with data from the preceding 5 years. In all Sri Lanka districts, dengue incidence in 2017 increased significantly over incidence during the previous 5 years. Older schoolchildren and young adults were more clinically symptomatic than those at extremes of age. Limited virologic surveillance showed the dominant circulating variant was dengue virus type 2 cosmopolitan genotype in the most affected district. One quarter of total annual cases were reported 5 weeks after the southwest monsoon started. Changes in vector abundance were not predictive of the increased incidence. Direct government expenditures on dengue control activities in 2017 were US $12.7 million. The lessons learned from this outbreak are useful for other tropical nations facing increasing dengue incidence.","We sincerely appreciate the support extended by Nimalka Pannila Hetti, Anoja Dheerasinghe, Mizaya Cader, .Sunith Kumarapperuma, Iroshini Abeysekara, Thanuja Rathnayaka, and Indika Weerasinghe.

We performed a genomic study on 48 cases of Enterobacter-caused bloodstream infection by using in silico DNA-DNA hybridization to identify precise species. Strains belonged to 12 species; Enterobacter xiangfangensis (n = 21) and an unnamed species (taxon 1, n = 8) were dominant. Most (63.5%) Enterobacter strains (n = 349) with genomes in GenBank from human blood are E. xiangfangensis; taxon 1 (19.8%) was next most common. E. xiangfangensis and taxon 1 were associated with increased deaths (20.7% vs. 15.8%), lengthier hospitalizations (median 31 d vs. 19.5 d), and higher resistance to aztreonam, cefepime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam, and tobramycin. Strains belonged to 37 sequence types (STs); ST171 (E. xiangfangensis) was most common (n = 6). Four ST171 strains belonged to a defined clone. Precise species identification has greater implications for epidemiology and infection control than treatment.","We are grateful for Alan McNally for his proofreading and helpful suggestions.

Effectively treating NS requires timely diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy matched to the causative pathogens, but most blood cultures for suspected NS do not recover a causative pathogen. We refer to these suspected but unidentified pathogens as microbial dark matter. Given these low culture recovery rates, many non-culture-based technologies are being explored to diagnose NS, including PCR, 16S amplicon sequencing, and whole metagenomic sequencing. However, few of these newer technologies are scalable or sustainable globally. To reduce worldwide deaths from NS, one possibility may be performing population-wide pathogen discovery. Because pathogen transmission patterns can vary across space and time, computational models can be built to predict the pathogens responsible for NS by region and season. This approach could help to optimally treat patients, decreasing deaths from NS and increasing antimicrobial stewardship until effective diagnostics that are scalable become available globally.",We are very grateful to Jessica Ericson and Sarah Morton for helpful discussions.

Major disparities in rates of iGAS exist between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, but much less is understood about iGAS among AI/AN in the United States. Although complex host-pathogen interactions influence the rates of iGAS, including strain variation and virulence, the number and type of concurrent conditions, and socioeconomic status, the relative contribution of each remains unclear. We highlight the poor correlation between the substantial effect of iGAS among Indigenous persons in industrialized countries and the current understanding of factors that influence iGAS disease in these populations.

We estimated the basic (R0) and effective (Re) reproduction numbers for 7,094 norovirus outbreaks reported to the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) during 2009-2017 and used regression models to assess whether transmission varied by outbreak setting. The median R0 was 2.75 (interquartile range [IQR] 2.38-3.65), and median Re was 1.29 (IQR 1.12-1.74). Long-term care and assisted living facilities had an R0 of 3.35 (95% CI 3.26-3.45), but R0 did not differ substantially for outbreaks in other settings, except for outbreaks in schools, colleges, and universities, which had an R0 of 2.92 (95% CI 2.82-3.03). Seasonally, R0 was lowest (3.11 [95% CI 2.97-3.25]) in summer and peaked in fall and winter. Overall, we saw little variability in transmission across different outbreaks settings in the United States.","This work was supported by funding from the Norovirus Vaccine Modeling (NoVaMod) project (grant no.

The age, sex, and geographic composition of the enrolled population during 2010-2018 remained proportionally stable, despite fluctuations in the number of enrollees. Annual incidence of Lyme disease diagnoses per 100,000 enrollees ranged from 49 to 88, ≈6-8 times higher than that observed for cases reported through notifiable disease surveillance. Age and sex distributions among Lyme disease diagnoses in MarketScan were similar to those of cases reported through surveillance, but proportionally more diagnoses occurred outside of peak summer months, among female enrollees, and outside high-incidence states. Misdiagnoses, particularly in low-incidence states, may account for some of the observed epidemiologic differences.

We obtained G. anatis isolates from bronchoalveolar lavage samples of 10 calves with bronchopneumonia unresponsive to antimicrobial therapy. Collected isolates were multidrug-resistant to extensively drug-resistant, exhibiting resistance against 5-7 classes of antimicrobial drugs. Whole-genome sequencing revealed 24 different antimicrobial-resistance determinants, including genes not previously described in the Gallibacterium genus or even the Pasteurellaceae family, such as aadA23, blaCARB-8, tet(Y), and qnrD1. Some resistance genes were closely linked in resistance gene cassettes with either transposases in close proximity or situated on putative mobile elements or predicted plasmids. Single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping revealed large genetic variation between the G. anatis isolates, including isolates retrieved from the same farm. G. anatis might play a hitherto unrecognized role as a respiratory pathogen and resistance gene reservoir in cattle and has unknown zoonotic potential.",We thank Marleen Foubert and Arlette Vandekerckhove for their excellent technical assistance.

Emerging advances in bioinformatics enable home computers to have powerful supercomputers, reducing the research expense, enhancing scientific efficiency, and accelerating novel discoveries. Bioinformatics can simply be understood as a field of data science based on the amalgamation of computers and biology. Nowadays, one of the major obstacles for humans is to attain a health system in which each patient could have a personalized medicine, as each patient possesses a unique genome, proteome, and metabolome. Hence, to understand complexity underlying diseases and its mechanism, bioinformatics can be a fundamental approach. One of the objectives of chapter is to present a comprehensive overview of bioinformatics, various omics tools and its applications, health informatics, and healthcare system. Big data technologies and their role in biomedical research is briefly addressed. The later dimension focuses on bioinformatics resources towards personalized medicine.

In humans, infection with this nematode often results in eosinophilic meningitis and other severe disorders of the central nervous system. Europe was deemed a nonendemic region until 2018, when A. cantonensis worms were detected on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, Spain, a tourism hotspot. Since that time, a sentinel surveillance system and a molecular approach have been used to follow the invasion path of the rat lungworm on the island. A. cantonensis worms have been found in animals from 8 locations on the island over 3 consecutive years. Our preliminary results show a recognizable pattern of clinical signs in infected hedgehogs and a single mitochondrial haplotype circulating in Mallorca.

HEV is acquired mainly by consumption of contaminated pork but can also be transmitted through blood transfusion. HEV infection is usually self-limited but can become persistent in immunocompromised persons. During the first 30 months of HEV RNA universal screening of blood donations in Catalonia, Spain, we identified 151 HEV RNA-positive donations (1/4,341 blood donations). Most infected donors reported consumption of pates and sausages, and 58% were negative for HEV IgM and IgG. All HEV isolates belonged to genotype 3. All infected donors spontaneously resolved the infection, and no neurologic symptoms and reinfections were observed after 1 year of follow-up. Since the implementation of HEV RNA universal screening, no new cases of transfusion-transmitted HEV infection were reported. Our data indicate HEV screening of blood donations provides safer blood for all recipients, especially for immunosuppressed persons.",We thank all technicians in the Transfusion Safety Laboratory for providing technical support.

Distinguishing DENVs from ZIKV using the established serologic assays widely used for monitoring DENV transmission is difficult because of antibody cross-reactivity between these closely related flaviviruses. We describe a modified and improved recombinant envelope domain III-based serologic assay for detecting ZIKV type-specific antibodies in regions with endemic DENV transmission. When the assay was used to measure ZIKV seroprevalence in 2017 among children 9-14 years of age living in a region of the Philippines with endemic DENV transmission, we observed a ZIKV seroprevalence of 18%. Investigators should consider using the ZIKV envelope domain III-based assay, which is simple and readily adaptable for use in standard clinical and public health laboratories, to assess ZIKV seroprevalence in areas with endemic DENV transmission.","We thank the children and their families in Balamban and Bogo City who volunteered for this study and the field staff who assisted with the study.

Giroux recently stated, the situation caused by the present pandemic of the Novel Corona Virus (SARS CoV-2) is not only a medical crisis, but even much more a “Socio-Political and Ideological crisis”, “crisis of Greed” and “Pedagogical crisis”. Consequently it is now absolutely essential to develop our Collective Imagination to produce possible Visions of the Future in which a novel global system of ecological production, distribution and usage of long-life high-quality products will only by necessity support the basic economic local production, distribution and usage of human survival essentials. In this sense an Information Communication Society, heavily leaning on organisational “skills” of computer and networking applications, will have to be envisioned, developed, organised and implemented on the global scale. The Information Communication Technologies and Computer Science developments will have to heavily concentrate primarily on enabling such an Information Communication Society, a future global society of local societies based on Kairology (the science of the right moment) and Synergy (co-operation) and rooted in proper present and future developments of the knowledge of Cybernetics (the science of dynamic systems) and Ecology (the science of the whole). This article tries to give a vision of how we could approach this goal.","The Author wishes to give special thanks, for invaluable scientific input, support and ideas, to Gordana Gredičak Šojat and Karolj Skala, the Croatian MIPRO Society for organising the ICT-20© COVID-19 on-line Conference, and also to the myriads of scientists, artists and thinkers who enabled the existence of our present day knowledge.

Recent viral outbreaks and pandemics have resulted in an increased research focus on the genetic diversity, population structure, and distribution of bat species. Lyle’s flying fox (Pteropus lylei) is widely distributed throughout central Thailand, with most colonies congregating in temples within proximity to humans. A lack of knowledge regarding the genetic connectivity among different colonies hinders the investigation of zoonotic disease epidemiology and wildlife management. In this study, we hypothesized that genetic material may be exchanged between Lyle’s flying fox colonies that live in proximity. We assessed the mitochondrial displacement loop and cytochrome b nucleotide sequences of samples collected from 94 individuals from ten colonies across different roosting sites and detected limited genetic differentiation but increased nucleotide divergence within colonies. This suggests that genetic connectivity among Lyle’s flying fox colonies has experienced frequent and recent gene flow. These findings indicate that this species has maintained demographic equilibrium in a stable population, with a slight expansion event in certain populations. These data provide insights into the dynamics of bat populations, and the genetic knowledge gained presents opportunities for the improved monitoring of bat population structure.","We thank the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation for assistance with sample collection and knowledge transfer, and the United States Agency for the International Development (USAID) Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT program.","This study was financially supported by grants from the Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP) of the United States Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA; HDTRA1-08-D-0007) awarded to P.D.; the Thailand Research Fund (TRF; No. RSA6180075) awarded to K.S.; a Research Chair Grant (P-13-01091) by the Cluster and Program Management Office (CPMO) (P-15-50535); the Higher Education for Industry Consortium (Hi-FI; No. 6414400777) awarded to N.A.; the Thailand Science Research and Innovation through the Kasetsart University Reinventing University Program 2021 (No. 3/2564) awarded to T.P.; the Wildlife habitat restoration for prey species of tiger in Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai Forest Complex project (No. P-18-51249) of the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) awarded to P.D.; and the Office of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation.

Simultaneous multi-omics data integration is a growing field of research as it has strong potential to unlock information on previously hidden biological relationships leading to early diagnosis, prognosis and expedited treatments. Many tools for multi-omics data integration are being developed. However, these tools are often restricted to highly specific experimental designs, and types of omics data. While some general methods do exist, they require specific data formats and experimental conditions. A major limitation in the field is a lack of a single or multi-omics pipeline which can accept data in an unrefined, information-rich form pre-integration and subsequently generate output for further investigation. There is an increasing demand for a generic multi-omics pipeline to facilitate general-purpose data exploration and analysis of heterogeneous data. Therefore, we present our R multiomics pipeline as an easy to use and flexible pipeline that takes unrefined multi-omics data as input, sample information and user-specified parameters to generate a list of output plots and data tables for quality control and downstream analysis. We have demonstrated application of the pipeline on two separate COVID-19 case studies. We enabled limited checkpointing where intermediate output is staged to allow continuation after errors or interruptions in the pipeline and generate a script for reproducing the analysis to improve reproducibility. A seamless integration with the mixOmics R package is achieved, as the R data object can be loaded and manipulated with mixOmics functions. Our pipeline can be installed as an R package or from the git repository, and is accompanied by detailed documentation with walkthroughs on two case studies. The pipeline is also available as Docker and Singularity containers.","S.

As one of the core resources in the National Genomics Data Center (NGDC), part of the China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ ), GWH accepts both full genome and partial genome (chloroplast, mitochondrion, and plasmid) sequences with different assembly levels, as well as an update of existing genome assemblies. For each assembly, GWH collects detailed genome-related metadata including biological project and sample, and genome assembly information, in addition to genome sequence and annotation. To archive high-quality genome sequences and annotations, GWH is equipped with a uniform and standardized procedure for quality control. Besides basic browse and search functionalities, all released genome sequences and annotations can be visualized with JBrowse. By December 2020, GWH has received 17,264 direct submissions covering a diversity of 949 species, and has released 3370 of them. Collectively, GWH serves as an important resource for genome-scale data management and provides free and publicly accessible data to support research activities throughout the world.

Their suitability for drug-likeness in humans is determined by a series of experiments that screen the compounds for different chemical, biological, and pharmacological properties. Traditionally, screening has been done straight on a laboratory bench, which is expensive and time consuming to come to the point of obtaining hits and leads. Artificial intelligence has brought faster and robust alternatives in screening for ADMET and other properties that phytochemicals need to have to qualify as drug candidates.

Elevated trypsin levels in the large intestine have been implicated in pathological conditions including infectious and inflammatory bowel disease2-4. Here we show that trypsin is regulated via degradation by members of the gut microbiota. After passing through the small intestine, trypsin activity is markedly reduced in the caecum of specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice, whereas germ-free (GF) mice have high luminal trypsin levels. We have successfully identified and isolated Paraprevotella strains from the faecal microbiome of healthy human donors as potent trypsin-degrading commensals. Mechanistically, Paraprevotella recruit trypsin to the bacterial surface through type IX secretion system-dependent polysaccharide-anchoring proteins and promote trypsin autolysis. Paraprevotella colonization protects IgA from trypsin degradation and enhances the effectiveness of oral vaccines against Citrobacter rodentium. Moreover, Paraprevotella colonization inhibits lethal infection with murine hepatitis virus, a mouse coronavirus dependent on trypsin and trypsin-like proteases for entry into host cells5,6. Congruently, carriage of putative genes involved in trypsin degradation in the gut microbiome was associated with reduced diarrhoea severity in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Therefore, trypsin-degrading commensal colonization may contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and protection from pathogen infection.",,,Research Square,,,Research Square Platform LLC,,,2022-04-05,2022,2022-04-05,,,,,All OA;

As human population immunity against these IAVs gradually decreases, the risk of reintroduction to humans increases. We examined 549 serum samples from persons 0-97 years of age collected in Belgium during 2017-2018 for hemagglutination inhibiting and virus neutralizing antibodies against 7 major H1 swine IAV (swIAV) clades and 3 human progenitor IAVs. Seroprevalence (titers >40) rates were >50% for classical swine and European human-like swIAVs, >24% for North American human-like δ1a and Asian avian-like swIAVs, and <10% for North American human-like δ1b and European avian-like swIAVs, but rates were age-dependent. Antibody titers against human-like swIAVs and supposed human precursor IAVs correlated with correlation coefficients of 0.30-0.86. Our serologic findings suggest that European avian-like, clade 1C.2.1, and North American human-like δ1b, clade 1B.2.2.2, H1 swIAVs pose the highest pandemic risk.","We thank Nele Dennequin, Melanie Bauwens, and Nathalie Vanderheijden for excellent technical assistance.

From November 2016 through February 2017, we collected sociodemographic and clinical data by interview and tested serum samples for CHIKV IgG. CHIKV seroprevalence was 11.8% (95% CI 9.8%-13.7%), and 15.3% of seropositive persons reported an episode of fever and arthralgia. Infections were independently and positively associated with residences served by unpaved streets, a presumptive clinical diagnosis of chikungunya, and recall of an episode of fever with arthralgia in 2015-2016. Our findings indicate that the chikungunya outbreak in Salvador may not have conferred sufficient herd immunity to preclude epidemics in the near future. The unusually low frequency of symptomatic disease points to a need for further longitudinal studies to better investigate these findings.","We thank the study participants and the community leaders from the Pau da Lima Urban Health Council who provided support for the investigation and the team members from Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (especially Perla Santana, Renan Rosa, Paula Sousa Barbosa, Leile Camila Jacob Nascimento, and Isabele de Pádua Carvalho), who participated in the data collection, laboratory experiments, or provided assistance with data management and administrative matters.

The review starts with an elaboration on the complex connotations of BMDB from the inter-disciplinary point of view. It then explores the implications of BMDB in sectors such as life science research, medical and health institutions, and biotechnology and bio-medicine industries in connection with the challenges and opportunities faced by social and economic development. The recent COVID-19 outbreak is used as an illustrative case study. The review ends with an analysis of a decade of BMBD practice, both domestically and abroad, with suggestions for policy-making and solutions to tackle major challenges from China’s perspective. It is hoped that any BMBD-related institutions, including administrative, academic, industrial, financial and social organizations,practitioners and users will benefit from this insightful summary drawn from the past decades of BMBD practice.

This book is designed to provide a foundational understanding of various applications of Big Data in Food Safety. Big Data requires the use of sophisticated approaches for cleaning, processing and extracting useful information to improve decision-making. The contributed volume reviews some of these approaches and algorithms in the context of real-world food safety studies. Food safety and quality related data are being generated in large volumes and from a variety of sources such as farms, processors, retailers, government organizations, and other industries. The editors have included examples of how big data can be used in the fields of bacteriology, virology and mycology to improve food safety. Additional chapters detail how the big data sources are aggregated and used in food safety and quality areas such as food spoilage and quality deterioration along the supply chain, food supply chain traceability, as well as policy and regulations. The volume also contains solutions to address standardization, data interoperability, and other data governance and data related technical challenges. Furthermore, this volume discusses how the application of machine-learning has successfully improved the speed and/or accuracy of many processes in the food supply chain, and also discusses some of the inherent challenges. Included in this volume as well is a practical example of the digital transformation that happened in Dubai, with a particular emphasis on how data is enabling better decision-making in food safety. To complete this volume, researchers discuss how although big data is and will continue to be a major disruptor in the area of food safety, it also raises some important questions with regards to issues such as security/privacy, data control and data governance, all of which must be carefully considered by governments and law makers.",,,Food Microbiology and Food Safety,,"Jeffrey Farber, Rozita Dara, Jennifer Ronholm",Springer Nature,"2629-1010, 2629-1029",,2023,2023,,2023,,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,2,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152949613,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences",,Generic health relevance,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,2 Zero Hunger

Here, we elucidate a new lung-gut axis mechanism and report that orally administered Clostridium butyricum (CB) enhances influenza virus infection resistance through upregulation of interferon (IFN)-λ in lung epithelial cells. Gut microbiome-induced ω-3 fatty acid, 18-hydroxy eicosapentaenoic acid (18-HEPE), promotes IFN-λ production through the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR)120 to the IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-1/-7 pathway. CB promotes 18-HEPE production in the gut and enhances ω-3 fatty acid sensitivity in the lungs by promoting GPR120 expression through modulation of the lung microbiome. In parallel, CB-producing proteins increase Bifidobacterium species in the lungs, resulting in the promotion of GPR120 expression in lung epithelial cells. Therefore, this study revealed a novel gut-lung axis mechanism and provides new insights into the treatments and prophylaxis for viral respiratory infections.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2022,2022,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Hagihara, Mao; Yamashita, Makoto; Ariyoshi, Tadashi; Eguchi, Shuhei; Minemura, Ayaka; Miura, Daiki; Higashi, Seiya; Oka, Kentaro; Nonogaki, Tsunemasa; Mori, Takeshi; Iwasaki, Kenta; Hirai, Jun; Shibata, Yuichi; Umemura, Takumi; Kato, Hideo; Asai, Nobuhiro; Yamagishi, Yuka; Ota, Akinobu; Takahashi, Motomichi; Mikamo, Hiroshige","Hagihara, Mao (Aichi Medical University - Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases); Yamashita, Makoto (Aichi Medical University - Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases); Ariyoshi, Tadashi (Aichi Medical University - Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases); Eguchi, Shuhei (Miyarisan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd - R&D Division); Minemura, Ayaka (Miyarisan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd - R&D Division); Miura, Daiki (Miyarisan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd - R&D Division); Higashi, Seiya (Miyarisan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd - R&D Division); Oka, Kentaro (Aichi Medical University - Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases); Nonogaki, Tsunemasa (Kinjo Gakuin University - College of Pharmacy); Mori, Takeshi (Aichi Medical University - Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases); Iwasaki, Kenta (Aichi Medical University - Departments of Kidney Disease and Transplant Immunology); Hirai, Jun (Aichi Medical University - Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases); Shibata, Yuichi (Aichi Medical University - Department of Molecular Epidemiology and Biomedical Sciences); Umemura, Takumi (Aichi Medical University - Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases); Kato, Hideo (Aichi Medical University - Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases); Asai, Nobuhiro (Aichi Medical University - Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases); Yamagishi, Yuka (Aichi Medical University - Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases); Ota, Akinobu (Aichi Medical University); Takahashi, Motomichi (Aichi Medical University - Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases); Mikamo, Hiroshige (Aichi Medical University - Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases)",,"Hagihara, Mao (Aichi Medical University); Yamashita, Makoto (Aichi Medical University); Ariyoshi, Tadashi (Aichi Medical University); Eguchi, Shuhei (); Minemura, Ayaka (); Miura, Daiki (); Higashi, Seiya (); Oka, Kentaro (Aichi Medical University); Nonogaki, Tsunemasa (); Mori, Takeshi (Aichi Medical University); Iwasaki, Kenta (Aichi Medical University); Hirai, Jun (Aichi Medical University); Shibata, Yuichi (Aichi Medical University); Umemura, Takumi (Aichi Medical University); Kato, Hideo (Aichi Medical University); Asai, Nobuhiro (Aichi Medical University); Yamagishi, Yuka (Aichi Medical University); Ota, Akinobu (Aichi Medical University); Takahashi, Motomichi (Aichi Medical University); Mikamo, Hiroshige (Aichi Medical University)",Aichi Medical University,grid.411234.1,Nagakute,,Japan,,,,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147370432,3107 Microbiology; 3207 Medical Microbiology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences,Lung; Influenza; Complementary and Integrative Health; Infectious Diseases; Pneumonia & Influenza; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Vaccine Related; Biodefense,Infection,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors; 2.2 Factors relating to the physical environment,Lung Cancer,2.1 Exogenous Factors in the Origin and Cause of Cancer,A01 Clinical Medicine,

Debates about ABS have moved on. The initial focus on the legal obligations established by international agreements like the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and the form of obligations for collecting physical biological materials have now shifted into a far more complex series of disputes and challenges about the ways ABS should be implemented and enforced. These now cover a wide range of issues, including digital sequence information, the repatriation of resources, technology transfer, traditional knowledge and cultural expressions, open access to information and knowledge, naming conventions, farmers' rights, new schemes for accessing pandemic viruses sharing DNA sequences and so on. Drawing together perspectives from an interdisciplinary range of leading and emerging international scholars, this book offers a new approach to the ABS landscape, as it breaks from the standard regulatory analyses in order to explore alternative solutions to the intractable issues for the access and benefit sharing of genetic resources. Addressing these modern legal debates from a perspective that will appeal to both ABS scholars and those with broader legal concerns in the areas of intellectual property, food, governance, Indigenous issues and so on, this book will be a useful resource for scholars and students as well as those in government and in international institutions working in relevant areas.",,,,,,Taylor & Francis,,,2022-09-06,2022,2022-09-06,,,,,All OA; Green,Edited Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,4,https://osf.io/nw8g9/download,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150812855,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4806 Private Law and Civil Obligations,Genetics,Generic health relevance,,,,C18 Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Drawing on the expertise of key scholars from around the world in the fields of international development, political science, socioeconomics, history, and international relations, the book explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on development aid within an environment of shifting national and regional priorities and interactions. The response is specifically focused on the interrelated themes of political analysis and soft power, the legitimation crisis, poverty, inequality, foreign aid, and the disruption and re-making of the world order. The book argues that complex and multidirectional linkages between politics, economics, society, and the environment are driving changes in the extant development aid system. COVID-19 and Foreign Aid provides a range of critical reflections to shifts in the world order, the rise of nationalism, the strange non-death of neoliberalism, shifts in globalisation, and the evolving impact of COVID as a cross-cutting crisis in the development aid system.

Since 2004, the State of Colorado has implemented multiple regulations to significantly reduce emissions from the O&G sector. The Denver‐Julesburg Basin (DJ Basin) is a significant O&G producing region in northern Colorado, and O&G production here has steadily increased over the last decade. To assess CH 4 trends in Northern Colorado, we selected CH 4 retrievals from the NASA Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument for 2003–2020. The study grid cell includes Denver, Boulder, and much of the dense O&G production in the DJ Basin. We computed mean June‐August ascending node AIRS 700 hPa CH 4 for each year and subtracted mean June–August CH 4 sampled at NOAA's Niwot Ridge (NWR) station, a high‐altitude background site. Differences represent estimated enhancement over background. Linear regression shows an annual change of −2.84 ppb ± 0.8 ppb from 2012 to 2020 ( R 2 0.90) and an estimated reduction of 56% for 2012–2020, despite substantial increases in O&G production. Local CH 4 enhancement is strongly correlated with surface measurements of ethane at Platteville which is in the center of the O&G fields (correlation coefficient 0.96), and this is evidence that reductions in O&G emissions are driving reductions in CH 4 . We conclude that AIRS CH 4 can be used to measure the efficacy of emissions control programs in this region and that regulatory requirements are having an effect. 
Key Points    Despite increases in local oil and gas production, methane enhancement in the Colorado study area declined significantly from 2012 to 2020   Decreases in both methane enhancement and ethane support the conclusion that emissions reduction efforts have been effective   Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) satellite methane retrievals can detect changes in boundary‐layer concentrations when mixing heights and source emissions are large","Acknowledgments This work was funded by the Board of County Commissioners of Weld County.

This article examines the potential impact of this shift on the access and benefit-sharing (ABS) regime of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya Protocol. These treaties require benefit-sharing with the owners of genetic resources. However, whether “genetic resources” include digital sequence information is unsettled. The CBD conceives genetic resources as genetic material containing functional units of heredity. “Material” implies tangibility, and for some scholars, “functional units of heredity,” undefined in both treaties, mean full-coding sequences. This article argues that digital sequence information obtained from physical genetic resources, full-coding or not, should be treated as genetic resources. Literal construction of the CBD risks eroding its usefulness and the ABS regime. This is because through bioinformatics, sequence information can easily be obtained from genetic resources for utilization, without physically moving them or concluding ABS agreement with owners. The CBD must evolve with scientific progress also because sequence functionality depends on the state of knowledge. These arguments are vindicated by domestic ABS laws equating genetic information with genetic resources; Nagoya Protocol provisions deeming research exploiting the genetic composition of genetic resources as utilization of genetic resources; and CBD provisions requiring the sharing of benefits from the utilization of genetic resources. Moreover, treaty interpretation and case law demand that generic, scientific terms, such as “genetic resources” and “functional units of heredity” be interpreted in an evolutionary manner to capture scientific developments.",The authors would like to thank the editor-in-chief and referees of NanoEthics for valuable comments on an earlier version of this article.,This article is supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2014/SS110/UKM/02/4).,NanoEthics,,,Springer Nature,"1871-4757, 1871-4765",,2023-03-28,2023,2023-03-28,2023-04,17,1,1,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Akpoviri, Frank Irikefe; Baharum, Syarul Nataqain; Zainol, Zinatul Ashiqin","Akpoviri, Frank Irikefe (Faculty of Law, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia); Baharum, Syarul Nataqain (Institute of Systems Biology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia); Zainol, Zinatul Ashiqin (Faculty of Law, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia)","Zainol, Zinatul Ashiqin (National University of Malaysia)","Akpoviri, Frank Irikefe (National University of Malaysia); Baharum, Syarul Nataqain (National University of Malaysia); Zainol, Zinatul Ashiqin (National University of Malaysia)",National University of Malaysia,grid.412113.4,Kuala Lumpur,,Malaysia,,,,,,0,0,,,1,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11569-023-00436-3.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156562254,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics,Genetics,,,,,C18 Law,15 Life on Land

Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radical activity and antioxidant activity, which can be studied in insects by transcriptome analysis. This study aimed to apply a meta-analysis approach to evaluate insect oxidative transcriptomes using publicly available data. We collected oxidative stress response-related RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for a wide variety of insect species, mainly from public gene expression databases, by manual curation. Only RNA-seq data of Drosophila melanogaster were found and were systematically analyzed using a newly developed RNA-seq analysis workflow for species without a reference genome sequence. The results were evaluated by two metric methods to construct a reference dataset for oxidative stress response studies. Many genes were found to be downregulated under oxidative stress and related to organ system process (GO:0003008) and adherens junction organization (GO:0034332) by gene enrichment analysis. A cross-species analysis was also performed. RNA-seq data of Caenorhabditis elegans were curated, since no RNA-seq data of insect species are currently available in public databases. This method, including the workflow developed, represents a powerful tool for deciphering conserved networks in oxidative stress response.",We thank Ms. Yoko Ono for helpful discussion.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces TB risk in HIV-infected adults, but its effectiveness in HIV-infected children and adolescents is unknown. We analyzed data from 7 integrated pediatric HIV/TB centers in 6 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a Bayesian mixed-effect model to assess association between ART and TB prevalence and used adaptive lasso regression to analyze risk factors for adverse TB outcomes. The study period encompassed 57,525 patient-years and 1,160 TB cases (2,017 cases/100,000 patient-years). Every 10% increase in ART uptake resulted in a 2.33% reduction in TB prevalence. Favorable TB outcomes were associated with increased time in care and early ART initiation, whereas severe immunosuppression was associated with death. These findings support integrated HIV/TB services for HIV-infected children and adults and demonstrate the association of ART uptake with decreased TB incidence in high HIV/TB settings.","We thank the local Ministry of Health officials, the Baylor teams, children, adolescents, and families across the Baylor International Pediatric AIDS Initiative at Texas Children’s Hospital network who contributed to this analysis. This work is in memory of Peter Nicholas Kazembe (1955–2020), who made monumental contributions to the health of children and families in Malawi and beyond..

For instance, machine learning algorithms can analyze big genomic data and predict genes, which helps researchers and scientists to gain deep insights about protein-coding genes in viruses that cause certain diseases. To elaborate, prediction of protein-coding genes from the genome of organisms is important to the synthesis of protein and the understating of the regulatory function of the non-coding region. Over the past few years, researchers have developed methods for finding protein-coding genes. Notwithstanding, the recent data explosion in genomics accentuates the need for efficient gene prediction algorithms. This book chapter presents an adaptive naive Bayes-based machine learning (NBML) algorithm to deploy over a cluster of the Apache Spark framework for efficient prediction of genes in the genome of eukaryotic organisms. To evaluate the NBML algorithm on its discovery of the protein-coding genes from the human genome chromosome GRCh37, a confusion matrix was constructed and its results show that NBML led to high specificity, precision and accuracy of 94.01%, 95.04% and 96.02%, respectively. Moreover, the algorithm can be effective for transfer knowledge in new genomic datasets.","This project is partially supported by (a) Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU), (b) Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and (c) University of Manitoba.",,Intelligent Systems Reference Library,Tracking and Preventing Diseases with Artificial Intelligence,"Mayuri Mehta, Philippe Fournier-Viger, Maulika Patel, Jerry Chun-Wei Lin",Springer Nature,"1868-4394, 1868-4408",,2021-07-15,2021,2021-07-15,2022,206,,103-123,Closed,Chapter,"Sarumi, Oluwafemi A.; Leung, Carson K.","Sarumi, Oluwafemi A.

Nonmonetary value is created when scientists access sequence data for discovery, collaboration, and innovation. Monetary value is created when genetic variability is leveraged to develop more robust and resilient crop plants, vibrant seed systems, more sustainable agriculture, and food security for consumers. Millions of dollars have been invested in curating and creating access to sequence databases and scientists from almost every country in the world have accessed these databases, free of charge. This access may now be threatened by well-meaning policy-makers who have not consulted with the scientific community. Monetizing or creating greater regulation of genetic sequence data would create barriers to innovation, partnering, and problem-solving.","The authors wish to acknowledge Kelly Albee and Nancy Wilmeth for their help with final preparation, editing, and formatting of the manuscript.",No funding was provided for the preparation of this manuscript.,Global Food Security,,,Elsevier,2211-9124,,2020-09,2020,,2020-09,26,,100411,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Gaffney, Jim; Tibebu, Redeat; Bart, Rebecca; Beyene, Getu; Girma, Dejene; Kane, Ndjido Ardo; Mace, Emma S.; Mockler, Todd; Nickson, Thomas E.; Taylor, Nigel; Zastrow-Hayes, Gina","Gaffney, Jim (Corteva Agriscience, USA); Tibebu, Redeat (College Biological Sciences, University of Minnesota, USA); Bart, Rebecca (Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, USA); Beyene, Getu (Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, USA); Girma, Dejene (National Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research, Ethiopia); Kane, Ndjido Ardo (Institut Sénégalais de Recherches Agricoles, Centre d’Étude Régional pour l’Amélioration de l’Adaptation à la Sécheresse, Senegal); Mace, Emma S.

However, reproducible re-use and management of sequence datasets remains a challenge. We created the software plugin q2-fondue to enable user-friendly acquisition, re-use, and management of public nucleotide sequence (meta)data while adhering to open data principles. The software allows fully provenance-tracked programmatic access to and management of data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Sequence data and accompanying metadata retrieved with q2-fondue follow a validated format, which is interoperable with the QIIME 2 ecosystem and its multiple user interfaces. To highlight the manifold capabilities of q2-fondue , we present several demonstration analyses using amplicon, whole genome, and shotgun metagenome datasets. These use cases demonstrate how q2-fondue increases analysis reproducibility and transparency from data download to final visualizations by including source details in the integrated provenance graph. We believe q2-fondue will lower existing barriers to comparative analyses of nucleotide sequence data, enabling more transparent, open, and reproducible conduct of meta-analyses. q2-fondue is a Python 3 package released under the BSD 3-clause license at https://github.com/bokulich-lab/q2-fondue .",We thank Evan Bolyen (Northern Arizona University) for insightful discussions on metadata processing and working with the SRA and SRA Toolkit.

The etymology of bioinformatics with several types of omics, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics was coined in the late twentieth century in the direction of the investigation and finding solutions for informatics processing in biological decision-making systems. Similarly, the data science era began and played a vital role in solving a large domain, particularly in biological problem solutions. In this conceptual article, an integrated machine learning-based framework for the prediction of outbreaks is proposed, followed by omics biological data processing and dimension reduction. Subsequently, various prominent benchmark tools have been shown related to problem solutions in data science and bioinformatics applications. In this study, the role of data science and soft computing approaches in bioinformatics disciplines with various associated applications is explored. Various simple soft computing techniques such as fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, support vector machines and evolutionary computation techniques have been explained. Furthermore, complex optimization and dimension reduction techniques, such as artificial bee colony, ant colony optimization, formal concept analysis, and principal component analysis have been presented.

Currently, the parties to the Nagoya Protocol debate whether digital sequence information (DSI) should also be subject to benefit-sharing. In fact, in the EU, the provisions of the Open Data Directive (ODD) of 2019 and the recently adopted Data Governance Act (DGA) already cover research data, including DSI. The ODD promotes the re-use of publicly funded research data to foster innovation but cannot resolve the systemic conflicts between benefit-sharing and open data. Furthermore, the DGA does not apply to DSI in desired cases and opens the door for the privatization of DSI. As a result, the current legal framework imposes chilling effects on research and effectively excludes DSI from further research and follow-on innovation. While future revisions of the ODD and the DGA should address some of these problems, a multilateral benefit-sharing mechanism for DSI is urgently needed.

In this study, we isolated a favipiravir-resistant mutant of Junin virus (JUNV), which is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever, and analyzed the antiviral mechanism of favipiravir against JUNV. Two amino acid substitutions, N462D in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and A168T in the glycoprotein precursor GPC, were identified in the mutant. GPC-A168T substitution enhanced the efficiency of JUNV internalization, which explains the robust replication kinetics of the mutant in the virus growth analysis. Although RdRp-N462D substitution did not affect polymerase activity levels in a minigenome system, comparisons of RdRp error frequencies showed that the virus with RdRp-D462 possessed a significantly higher fidelity. We also provided experimental evidence for the first time that favipiravir inhibited JUNV through the accumulation of transition mutations, confirming its role as a purine analogue against arenaviruses. Moreover, we showed that treatment with a combination of favipiravir and either ribavirin or remdesivir inhibited JUNV replication in a synergistic manner, blocking the generation of the drug-resistant mutant. Our findings provide new insights for the clinical management and treatment of Argentine hemorrhagic fever.","We are grateful to Dr. Haruka Abe for his helpful discussions and valuable comments on this manuscript.

With the rapid increase in availability of new clinical data sources and with the evolution of new AI-based technologies, its clinical applications are significantly increasing. AI in medicine and medical domain is helping administrators, practitioners, patients and other stakeholders by emulating the intelligent behavior of human in computers and in other specialized machines that are being used in many promising medical care applications. The availability of large standard datasets is crucial for the training of these AI-based systems. A variety of medical data sources specifically used in diagnosis process exist such as (1) numeric and textual data – that basically includes patient's attributes, i.e. gender, age, clinical history, disease symptoms and physical examination results, that are mostly used for risk prediction of particular disease, textual reports, i.e. physical examination outcomes, operative notes, laboratory reports and discharge summaries; (2) images data – that encompasses screened images obtained from different modalities such as radiology images (i.e. X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), dermoscopy images, fundus and eye screening images, pathology images and many more; (3) sound data – such as ultrasound (US), heart sound signals that are used for early diagnoses of disease and analysis of internal human body parts; (4) genetic data – used for the diagnosis of several complex diseases such as cancers, Down's syndrome and infectious disease. The successful applications of AI in healthcare attracted many small and large companies to invest in this domain. Such companies include Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Nvidia. Broad categories of AI methods are being employed by researchers to provide better solutions in medical domain. These methods mainly include (1) knowledge-based expert systems (ES), which are primarily based upon a series of if-then rules defined by the domain experts, specifically utilized in clinical decision support systems; (2) machine learning (ML), in which statistical models are trained over different clinical datasets to perform tasks like disease detection, treatment planning and disease prediction; (3) deep learning (DL), which is state-of-the-art auto learning mechanism based on multilayer perceptron and their enhanced forms that can assists in risk prediction, prognosis, detection and diagnosis of different disease etc. by recognizing patterns in training data. There are numerous application areas where AI methods can be used to improve the performance of systems and clinical results, which may include (1) computer vision, which assists in detection and diagnosis of disease and in monitoring of patients using medical images like X-rays, MRIs and US; (2) natural language processing (NLP), which assists in creation and interpretation of patient's medical reports using structured and unstructured medical and contextual data; (3) wearable devices, which help in patient's monitoring (i.e. observe patient's health condition) by recording different biomedical signals (i.e. blood pressure, heartbeat); and (4) virtual assistants, which are autonomous entities that can formulate their decisions based on their interactions with their environment and their self-learning mechanism. These are the systems that can operate in the absence of human intelligence and may range from simple systems like thermostat to complex networked systems like army of robots. In addition to these, AI also assists in the production of new medicines, in prediction of drug-drug interaction, and helps patients using virtual assistants or chatbots, backings doctors in patient monitoring using Web-based or cloud-based systems, contributing in administrative tasks etc. Among all of these wonderful applications of AI, automated disease diagnosis is the major and the most successful domain. Providing the right and optimal diagnosis at the right time is an important aspect of medical care industry. Normally, radiologists and other clinicians perform manual scrutiny of these screened images to find different abnormalities, which requires a large amount of time and may prone to subjectivity. Moreover, the chance of errors could be further increased due to lack of expert's experience, visual fatigue, physical health issues of professionals etc. One of the potential solutions to this problem is intervention of computerized AI-based systems in healthcare to reduce these medication errors. This chapter presents an extensive study of some AI technologies and their applications in the detection, diagnosis, disease treatment, prediction and prescription of different human diseases. Our main goal here is to draw a bigger picture and establish the context for the remainder of this book. The chapter is structured as follows: we will first explore different types of medical data and their use in AI-based healthcare. After that, we will introduce some AI technologies and its applications used in medical care systems. We will then learn how these AI technologies and medical data are being used by AI systems for detection, prediction and diagnosis of different types of disease. At the end of this chapter, we will cover benefits and challenges of using those AI systems in medical care. This chapter presents an extensive study of some Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and their applications in the detection, diagnosis, disease treatment, prediction and prescription of different human diseases. It explores different types of medical data and their use in AI-based healthcare. AI is revolutionizing whether to find relationships between genomic codes, to develop virtual robots to perform surgery or to maximize the efficiency of a bigger health-care unit, i.e. hospital. This vast use of AI in medical care even fuels the debate whether AI doctors will finally replace the human doctors in future.

The objective of this study was to determine the antibiotic resistance of Campylobacter in children.Methods Stool samples were collected from pediatric patients under 14 years of age who visited hospital for acute diarrhea between February 2018 and January 2019. Campylobacter was isolated from samples using selective enrichment and culture and confirmed by PCR, genotypes were characterized by multilocus sequencing, and antibiotic resistance was determined by susceptibility and resistance genes to antimicrobials of medical importance.Results The overall prevalence of Campylobacter in children with diarrhea was 4.4% (53/1197). Higher prevalence was observed in children under five-year-old and in spring and autumn. Approximately 80% (42/53) of confirmed isolates were C. jejuni and ~ 20% (11/53) isolates were C. coli. Among the 51 isolates successfully typed, 43 sequence types belonging to 13 clonal complexes were identified, of which 44.2% (19/43) sequence types were novel. The majority of the Campylobacter isolates (74%) exhibited multidrug resistance and the most common antimicrobials resistant to were ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and nalidixic acid. All isolates (53/53) were positive of the tet(O) gene that confers resistance to tetracycline and the gyrA gene that confers resistance to quinolones/fluoroquinolones, 81% (43/53) isolates were positive of the ermB gene that confers resistance to macrolides, and 19% (10/53) isolates were positive of the aadE-sat4-aphA gene that confers resistance to aminoglycosides, respectively.Conclusions Despite the low prevalence of Campylobacter in children in the subtropical Guangzhou metropolitan, the high multidrug resistance of diverse MLST of Campylobacter indicated the importance of preventive strategies including routine surveillance in order to minimize the infections of antibiotic resistant Campylobacter in children.",,,Research Square,,,Research Square Platform LLC,,,2023-07-19,2023,2023-07-19,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Hou, Shuiping; Mei, Peng; Shi, Runfeng; Chen, Kuncai; pan, Xinhong; Chen, shouyi; Li, Juntao","Hou, Shuiping (Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention); Mei, Peng (Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Dongguan City,); Shi, Runfeng (Southern Medical University); Chen, Kuncai (Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention); pan, Xinhong (Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention); Chen, shouyi (Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention); Li, Juntao (Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention)",,"Hou, Shuiping (Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention); Mei, Peng (); Shi, Runfeng (Southern Medical University); Chen, Kuncai (Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention); pan, Xinhong (Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention); Chen, shouyi (Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention); Li, Juntao (Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention)",Southern Medical University; Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention,grid.284723.8; grid.508371.8,Guangzhou; Guangzhou,Guangdong; ,China; China,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3008510/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160827106,31 Biological Sciences; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3107 Microbiology; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Prevention; Antimicrobial Resistance; Genetics; Vaccine Related; Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Digestive Diseases; Foodborne Illness,Infection,,,,A01 Clinical Medicine,3 Good Health and Well Being

The accumulation of intestinal-flora-related studies enables us to better understand the various relationships between human gut microbes and other factors that affect the human body. However, the existing database does not meet the requirements of scientists to browse or retrieve the latest and most comprehensive published data. Thus, a knowledge base containing data related to gut microbes with updates occurring in real time would be highly valuable. We present a knowledge base of consistently curated relationships between human gut microbes and disease. By continuously and automatically collecting papers published in mainstream journals and using deep learning and NLP methods for entity relationship identification, GDReBase has now integrated 3674 diseases, 687 microbes, 7068 relationships, and 13,553 pieces of evidence from 518,286 papers, a figure that will continue to grow.

The main objective of this study was to map out the interest and capacity for conducting bioinformatics and related research in Tanzania. The survey collected demographic information like age group, experience, seniority level, gender, number of respondents per institution, number of publications, and willingness to join the community of practice. The survey also investigated the capacity of individuals and institutions about computing infrastructure, operating system use, statistical packages in use, the basic Microsoft packages experience, programming language experience, bioinformatics tools and resources usage, and type of analyses performed. Moreover, respondents were surveyed about the challenges they faced in implementing bioinformatics and their willingness to join the bioinformatics community of practice in Tanzania. Out of 84 respondents, 50 (59.5%) were males. More than half of these 44 (52.4%) were between 26–32 years. The majority, 41 (48.8%), were master’s degree holders with at least one publication related to bioinformatics. Eighty (95.2%) were willing to join the bioinformatics network and initiative in Tanzania. The major challenge faced by 22 (26.2%) respondents was the lack of training and skills. The most used resources for bioinformatics analyses were BLAST, PubMed, and GenBank. Most respondents who performed analyses included sequence alignment and phylogenetics, which was reported by 57 (67.9%) and 42 (50%) of the respondents, respectively. The most frequently used statistical software packages were SPSS and R. A quarter of the respondents were conversant with computer programming. Early career and young scientists were the largest groups of responders engaged in bioinformatics research and activities across surveyed institutions in Tanzania. The use of bioinformatics tools for analysis is still low, including basic analysis tools such as BLAST, GenBank, sequence alignment software, Swiss-prot and TrEMBL. There is also poor access to resources and tools for bioinformatics analyses.

to cause over 10 million deaths per year and cost the global economy 100
trillion USD by 2050 under status quo projections. These losses would mainly
result from an increase in the morbidity and mortality from treatment failure,
AMR infections during medical procedures, and a loss of quality of life
attributed to AMR. Numerous interventions have been proposed to control the
development of AMR and mitigate the risks posed by its spread. This paper
reviews key aspects of bacterial AMR management and control which make
essential use of data technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine
learning, and mathematical and statistical modelling, fields that have seen
rapid developments in this century. Although data technologies have become an
integral part of biomedical research, their impact on AMR management has
remained modest. We outline the use of data technologies to combat AMR,
detailing recent advancements in four complementary categories: surveillance,
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. We provide an overview on current AMR
control approaches using data technologies within biomedical research, clinical
practice, and in the ""One Health"" context. We discuss the potential impact and
challenges wider implementation of data technologies is facing in high-income
as well as in low- and middle-income countries, and recommend concrete actions

749,pub.1147957288,10.1101/2022.05.12.491592,,,,Targeting Echinococcus multilocularis PIM kinase for improving anti-parasitic chemotherapy,"Abstract  Background  The potentially lethal zoonosis alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is caused by the metacestode larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis . Current AE treatment options are limited and rely on surgery as well as on chemotherapy involving benzimidazoles (BZ). BZ treatment, however, is parasitostatic only, must be given for prolonged time periods, and is associated with adverse side effects. Novel treatment options are thus urgently needed.    Methodology/Principal findings  By applying a broad range of kinase inhibitors to E. multilocularis stem cell cultures we identified the proto-oncogene PIM kinase as a promising target for anti-AE chemotherapy. The gene encoding the respective E. multilocularis ortholog, EmPIM, was characterized and in situ hybridization assays indicated its expression in parasite stem cells. By yeast two-hybrid assays we demonstrate interaction of EmPIM with E. multilocularis CDC25, indicating an involvement of EmPIM in parasite cell cycle regulation. Small molecule compounds SGI-1776 and CX-6258, originally found to effectively inhibit human PIM kinases, exhibited detrimental effects on in vitro cultured parasite metacestode vesicles and prevented the formation of mature vesicles from parasite stem cell cultures. To improve compound specificity for EmPIM, we applied a high throughput in silico modelling approach, leading to the identification of compound Z196138710. When applied to in vitro cultured metacestode vesicles and parasite cell cultures, Z196138710 proved equally detrimental as SGI-1776 and CX-6258, but displayed significantly reduced toxicity towards human HEK293T and HepG2 cells.    Conclusions/Significance  Repurposing of kinase inhibitors initially designed to affect mammalian kinases for helminth disease treatment is often hampered by adverse side effects of respective compounds on human cells. Here we demonstrate the utility of high throughput in silico approaches to design small molecule compounds of higher specificity for parasite cells. We propose EmPIM as a promising target for respective approaches towards AE treatment.    Author summary  The larva of the tapeworm E. multilocularis grows tumor-like within the host liver, thus causing the lethal disease alveolar echinococcosis (AE). Anti-parasitic treatment relies on chemotherapy with benzimidazoles, which do not kill the parasite and must be applied for years. As druggable enzymes with key functions in growth control, protein kinases are promising drug targets and many kinase inhibitors have been identified during cancer research. Optimized for binding to human kinases, however, repurposing of such drugs for parasitic disease treatment is associated with adverse side effects. Herein, the authors applied an in silico approach to identify small molecule compounds that show higher specificity for a parasite kinase, EmPIM, over its mammalian homologs. The authors demonstrate expression of EmPIM in Echinococcus stem cells, which are the drivers of parasite growth, and show that mammalian PIM kinase inhibitors SGI-1776 and CX-6258 also affect parasite development in vitro . Finally, they show that one of the in silico screened compounds is equally effective against the parasite as SGI-1776 and CX-6258, but significantly less toxic to human cells. These results demonstrate the utility of in silico approaches to identify parasite-specific kinase inhibitors.",The authors wish to thank Monika Bergmann and Dirk Radloff for excellent technical assistance.,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,2022-05-12,2022,2022-05-12,,,,2022.05.12.491592,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Koike, Akito; Becker, Frank; Sennhenn, Peter; Kim, Jason; Zhang, Jenny; Hannus, Stefan; Brehm, Klaus","Koike, Akito (University of Würzburg, Institute of Hygiene and Microbiology, Consultant Laboratory for Echinococcosis, Würzburg, Germany); Becker, Frank (Intana Bioscience GmbH, Martinsried, Germany); Sennhenn, Peter (MedChem Consulting, München, Germany); Kim, Jason (Immuneering Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA); Zhang, Jenny (Immuneering Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA); Hannus, Stefan (Intana Bioscience GmbH, Martinsried, Germany); Brehm, Klaus (University of Würzburg, Institute of Hygiene and Microbiology, Consultant Laboratory for Echinococcosis, Würzburg, Germany)","Brehm, Klaus (University of Würzburg)","Koike, Akito (University of Würzburg); Becker, Frank (); Sennhenn, Peter (); Kim, Jason (); Zhang, Jenny (); Hannus, Stefan (); Brehm, Klaus (University of Würzburg)",University of Würzburg,grid.8379.5,Wurzburg,Bayern,Germany,,,,,,0,0,,,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/05/12/2022.05.12.491592.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147957288,"3009 Veterinary Sciences; 30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences",Cancer; Biotechnology; Digestive Diseases; Rare Diseases; Orphan Drug,Cancer,5.1 Pharmaceuticals,,,A01 Clinical Medicine,3 Good Health and Well Being

Here we propose a novel gene-based testing framework that incorporates data on long-range chromatin interactions, several recent technical advances for region-based tests, and leverages the knockoff framework for synthetic genotype generation for improved gene discovery. Through simulations and applications to GWAS and whole-genome sequencing data for multiple diseases and traits we show that the proposed test increases the power over state-of-the-art gene-based tests in the literature, identifies genes that replicate in larger studies, and can provide a more narrow focus on the possible causal genes at a locus by reducing the confounding effect of linkage disequilibrium. Furthermore, our results show that incorporating genetic variation in distal regulatory elements tends to improve power over conventional tests. Results for UK Biobank and BioBank Japan traits are also available in a publicly accessible database that allows researchers to query gene-based results in an easy fashion.  Significance Gene-based tests are important tools for elucidating the genetic basis of complex traits. Despite substantial recent efforts in this direction, the existing tests are still limited owing to low power and detection of false positive signals due to the confounding effects of linkage disequilibrium. In this paper we describe a novel gene-based test that attempts to address these limitations by incorporating data on long-range chromatin interactions, several recent technical advances for region-based testing, and the knockoff framework for synthetic genotype generation. Through extensive simulations and applications to multiple diseases and traits, we show that the proposed test increases the power over state-of-the-art gene-based tests and provides a narrower focus on the possible causal genes involved at a locus.",This research was supported by NIH/NIMH awards MH106910 and MH095797 (IIL) and NIH/NIA award AG066206 (ZH).

In contrast, the existing nucleotide databases were not consolidated to facilitate wider and deeper homology search. Here, we built a comprehensive database by including the noncoding RNA sequences from RNAcentral, the transcriptome assembly and metagenome assembly from MG-RAST, the genomic sequences from Genome Warehouse (GWH), and the genomic sequences from MGnify, in addition to NCBI’s nucleotide database (nt) and its subsets. The resulting MARS database (Master database of All possible RNA sequences) is 20-fold larger than NCBI’s nt database or 60-fold larger than RNAcentral. The new dataset along with a new split-search strategy allows a substantial improvement in homology search over existing state-of-the-art techniques. It also yields more accurate and more sensitive multiple sequence alignments (MSA) than manually curated MSAs from Rfam for the majority of structured RNAs mapped to Rfam. The results indicate that MARS coupled with the fully automatic homology search tool RNAcmap will be useful for improved structural and functional inference of noncoding RNAs.","The authors gratefully acknowledge that the High Performance Computing Cluster at Shenzhen Bay Laboratory was involved in completing this research.

The CEL cells were infected with FAdV isolate (UPM08136) passage 5 (UPM08136CELP5) or passage 20 (UPM08136CELP20) and monitored until cell detachment. Immunofluorescence, TCID50, sequencing, alignment of hexon and fiber genes, and phylogenetic analysis were carried out. CEL cells were adapted well to Cytodex™ 1 microcarriers and successfully propagated the FAdV isolates in STB with virus titer of 107.5 (UPM08136CELP5B1) and 106.5 (UPM08136CELP20B1) TCID50/mL. These isolates clustered with the reference FAdV serotype 8b in the same evolutionary clade. The molecular characteristics remained unchanged, except for a point substitution at position 4 of the hexon gene of UPM08136CELP20B1, suggesting that propagation of the FAdV isolate in STB is stable and suitable for large volume production and could be a breakthrough in the scale-up process.",,"This research was funded by UNIVERSITI PUTRA MALAYSIA., grant number vot 6300899.",Processes,,,MDPI,2227-9717,,2020-09-01,2020,2020-09-01,,8,9,1065,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ugwu, Chidozie C.; Hair-Bejo, Mohd; Nurulfiza, Mat I.; Omar, Abdul R.; Ideris, Aini","Ugwu, Chidozie C.

We have a very long way to go, Each time we discover a new phenomenon, we spend excessive time learning about its anatomy, but we get motivated to keep marching for further knowledge and scientific illimitation. Then we came to the Central Dogma conundrum. Simply speaking, it is the relationship between nucleic acids and proteins. It is so important to modern biology, which describes the flow of information as one-way, from DNA to RNA to protein. Then we arrive at CRISPR, the magic knife that can join the discovery of fire and the invention of the wheel. When the CRISPR Cas9 protein is added to a cell along with a piece of guide RNA, the Cas9 protein hooks up with the guide RNA and then moves along the strands of DNA until it finds and binds to a 20-DNA-letter long sequence that matches part of the guide RNA sequence. That's impressive, given that the DNA packed into each of our cells has six billion letters and is 2m long. CRISPR technology also has the potential to transform medicine, enabling us to not only treat but also prevent many diseases. We may even decide to use it to change the genomes of our children. An attempt to do this in China has been condemned as premature and unethical, but many geneticists believe—with ample testing, it will benefit children in the future. Unfortunately, Bio-hacker love CRISPR because it gave them an easy way to hack the human genome. Biohacking-as-a-Service has been riding on the leading edge of technology. It is amazing what the devious mind can do.

DNA sequence variants lead to phenotypic differences among individuals, while within an individual, RNA dynamically confers cell identity and responds to cellular and environmental signals. To provide regulation for different cell types and conditions, the nucleotides of RNA are modified by hundreds of chemical reactions, and RNA folds into innumerable shapes. To decipher the RNA regulatory code is to understand how RNA sequence and structure respond to cellular needs. Here, we deciphered one part of the RNA code where RNA abasic sites in R-loops regulate transcription by pausing RNA polymerase II. We uncovered an enhancer RNA, AANCR, that regulates the transcription and expression of APOE . When AANCR is folded into an R-loop, which is then modified by N6-adenine methylation and N-glycosidic cleavage, it is a partially transcribed nonfunctional enhancer and APOE is not expressed. In contrast, in some cell types and under stress, AANCR does not form a stable R-loop as its sequence is not modified, so it is transcribed into a full-length enhancer that promotes APOE expression. By genetic analysis, we confirmed that AANCR regulates APOE expression. DNA sequence variants in AANCR are associated with APOE expression and also with Alzheimer’s disease. Our data show that DNA and RNA sequence and structure jointly regulate gene expression that influence disease risk.   Highlights   m6A, RNA abasic sites and R-loops jointly regulate transcription by pausing RNA Polymerase II.    An enhancer RNA regulates APOE expression.     Enhancer RNA of APOE modifies susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease.","We thank Annelise Comai for assistance with data processing and analysis. We thank Drs.

Furthermore, open data sharing improves the reproducibility and quality of research and enables new collaborations powered by the freely available data. Open data are defined as data that can be freely used, reused, and redistributed by anyone. For an interdisciplinary field like biological anthropology, data sharing is critical since one person cannot easily collect data across the domains relevant to our field. The goal of this paper is to encourage broader data sharing in our discipline by exploring the state of data sharing in the field of biological anthropology. Our paper is divided into four parts: the first section describes the benefits, challenges, and emerging solutions to open data sharing; the second section presents the results of our data archiving and sharing survey that was completed by over 700 researchers; the third section presents personal experiences of data sharing by the authors; and the fourth section discusses the strengths of different types of data repositories and provides a list of recommended data repositories.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Thank you to Ben Marwick for providing his personal experiences with data sharing as an archaeologist and advocate of open data sharing.

Despite a great success of plant breeding, it suffers with few challenges like laborious phenotyping, tedious, resource intensive, and environment dependent which slow down the genetic gain and the cultivar improvement process. The marker assisted breeding or marker assisted selection has evolved gradually as genomics assisted breeding (GAB). In the recent times, genomics has contributed significantly to the selection intensity and selection accuracy which leads to genetic gain in crop improvement and significantly decrease the breeding cycle time and required workforce during selection. Hence it complements during the selections and the process of cultivar improvement. GAB has been deployed in breeding high yielding varieties; abiotic and biotic stress tolerant varieties and climate resilient varieties of food crops. Though the GAB has a great potential for sustainable agriculture, several bottlenecks still impede its direct application. Efforts are needed to divert in direction to overcome the bottlenecks associated with GAB which will help to achieve full potential of GAB in crop improvement and food security.

It takes an inclusive approach in order to capture not only the international initiatives to map and sequence the genomes of various organisms, but also the work of smaller-scale institutions engaged in the mapping and sequencing of yeast, human and pig DNA. In doing so, the authors expand the historiographical lens of genomics from a focus on large-scale projects to other forms of organisation. They show how practices such as genome mapping, sequence assembly and annotation are as essential as DNA sequencing in the history of genomics, and argue that existing depictions of genomics are too closely associated with the Human Genome Project. Exploring the use of genomic tools by biochemists, cell biologists, and medical and agriculturally-oriented geneticists, this book portrays the history of genomics as inseparably entangled with the day-to-day practices and objectives of these communities. The authors also uncover often forgotten actors such as the European Commission, a crucial funder and forger of collaborative networks undertaking genomic projects. In examining historical trajectories across species, communities and projects, the book provides new insights on genomics, its dramatic expansion during the late twentieth-century and its developments in the twenty-first century. Offering the first extensive critical examination of the nature and historicity of reference genomes, this book demonstrates how their affordances and limitations are shaped by the involvement or absence of particular communities in their production.

Technological advancements and other related trends are contributing to the production of an astoundingly large and exponentially increasing collection of data and information, referred to in popular vernacular as “Big Data.” Social media and crowdsourcing platforms and various applications ― “apps” ― are producing reams of information from the instantaneous transactions and input of millions and millions of people around the globe. The Internet-of-Things (IoT), which is expected to comprise tens of billions of objects by the end of this decade, is actively sensing real-time intelligence on nearly every aspect of our lives and environment. The Global Positioning System (GPS) and other location-aware technologies are producing data that is specific down to particular latitude and longitude coordinates and seconds of the day. Large-scale instruments, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), are collecting massive amounts of data on our planet and even distant corners of the visible universe. Digitization is being used to convert large collections of documents from print to digital format, giving rise to large archives of unstructured data. Innovations in technology, in the areas of Cloud and molecular computing, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to name only a few, also are greatly expanding our capacity to store, manage, and process Big Data. In this context, the Encyclopedia of Big Data is being offered in recognition of a world that is rapidly moving from gigabytes to terabytes to petabytes and beyond. While indeed large data sets have long been around and in use in a variety of fields, the era of Big Data in which we now live departs from the past in a number of key respects and with this departure comes a fresh set of challenges and opportunities that cut across and affect multiple sectors and disciplines, and the public at large. With expanded analytical capacities at hand, Big Data is now being used for scientific inquiry and experimentation in nearly every (if not all) disciplines, from the social sciences to the humanities to the natural sciences, and more. Moreover, the use of Big Data has been well established beyond the Ivory Tower. In today’s economy, businesses simply cannot be competitive without engaging Big Data in one way or another in support of operations, management, planning, or simply basic hiring decisions. In all levels of government, Big Data is being used to engage citizens and to guide policy making in pursuit of the interests of the public and society in general. Moreover, the changing nature of Big Data also raises new issues and concerns related to, for example, privacy, liability, security, access, and even the veracity of the data itself. Given the complex issues attending Big Data, there is a real need for a reference book that covers the subject from a multi-disciplinary, cross-sectoral, comprehensive, and international perspective. The Encyclopedia of Big Data will address this need and will be the first of such reference books to do so. Featuring some 500 entries, from ""Access"" to ""Zillow,"" the Encyclopedia will serve as a fundamental resource for researchers and students, for decision makers and leaders, and for business analysts and purveyors. Developed for those in academia, industry, and government, and others with a general interest in Big Data, the encyclopedia will be aimed especially at those involved in its collection, analysis, and use. Ultimately, the Encyclopedia of Big Data will provide a common platform and language covering the breadth and depth of the topic for different segments, sectors, and disciplines.",,,,,"Laurie A.

The continuous emergence and evolution of pathogenic E. coli strains associated with human and animal infections have demonstrated that (i) groups of related pathogenic E. coli are responsible for most infections caused by this bacterial species; (ii) diverse virulence phenotypes expressed during infection defined each one of these pathogroups; (iii) the geographical distribution of pathogroups in Latin America and the evolution of new isolates was defined by the dominant pathogroup and presence of distinct virulence strains; (iv) acquisition of mobile elements or accumulation of point mutations accelerate the development of antibiotic resistance in some of these strains. The Latin American Coalition for Escherichia coli Research (LACER), a multidisciplinary network of over seventy research groups in eleven Latin American countries and the USA, was established in 2009 to apply One Health principles in defining and combating this pathogen. The previous edition of this text, Escherichia coli in the Americas was the culmination of the investigators' wisdom about E. coli, from its role as a commensal bacterium to its characteristics as a pathogen. This new edition introduces recent advances and contextualizes all aspects of E. coli in a One Health perspective, from the environment, to animals, to humans. It addresses E. coli interactions with host microbiota, CNS, and phages, and includes cutting edge insights on hybrid strains, molecular mechanisms of virulence and pathogenesis, domestic and wild reservoirs, disease surveillance in Latin America, food safety, and new therapies. Crucially, it also presents translations and analysis of key reports on Escherichia coli published in Spanish and Portuguese.

Understanding interaction of crop plants to the biotic stresses caused by insects, bacteria, fungi, viruses, and oomycetes, etc. is important to develop resistant crop varieties. Knowledge on the advanced genetic and genomic crop improvement strategies including molecular breeding, transgenics, genomic-assisted breeding and the recently emerging genome editing for developing resistant varieties in pulse crops is imperative for addressing FPNEE (food, health, nutrition. energy and environment) security. Whole genome sequencing of these crops followed by genotyping-by-sequencing have facilitated precise information about the genes conferring resistance useful for gene discovery, allele mining and shuttle breeding which in turn opened up the scope for 'designing' crop genomes with resistance to biotic stresses. The nine chapters each dedicated to a pulse crop in this volume elucidate on different types of biotic stress agents and their effects on and interaction with the crop plants; enumerate on the available genetic diversity with regard to biotic stress resistance among available cultivars; illuminate on the potential gene pools for utilization in interspecific gene transfer; present brief on the classical genetics of stress resistance and traditional breeding for transferring them to their cultivated counterparts; depict the success stories of genetic engineering for developing biotic stress resistant varieties; discuss on molecular mapping of genes and QTLs underlying biotic stress resistance and their marker-assisted introgression into elite varieties; enunciate on different emerging genomics-aided techniques including genomic selection, allele mining, gene discovery and gene pyramiding for developing resistant crop varieties with higher quantity and quality of yields; and also elaborate some case studies on genome editing focusing on specific genes for generating disease and insect resistant crops.",,,,,Chittaranjan Kole,Springer Nature,,,2022,2022,,2022,,,,All OA; Green,Edited Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,4,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm:978-3-030-91043-3/1?pdf=chapter%20toc,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146379281,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3008 Horticultural Production",Genetics; Human Genome; Biotechnology,,,,,"A06 Agriculture, Veterinary and Food Science",2 Zero Hunger
